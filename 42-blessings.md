THE BLESSING OF A CHURCH BELL 


The bell to be blessed should be thoroughly cleansed 
beforehand, both within and without, and should be sus- 
pended so that its lip may be three or four feet above 
the ground. Before the service is begun, four small 
crosses should be marked with chalk upon the upper 
part of the sides of the bell, denoting the North, East, 
South and West points respectively. Also seven small 
crosses should be marked with chalk at equal distances 
upon the outside of the lip of the bell, to indicate to 
the Bishop where the oil is to be applied. An Acolyte 
or other assistant should precede the Bishop as he walks 
round the bell, and should wipe off with a damp cloth 
each of the chalk crosses just before the Bishop touches 
the spot with the Holy Oil. 


The Thymiama (which according to ancient custom 
is a mixture of ground myrrh, resin and incense) should 
be prepared beforehand, and a brazier with glowing 
embers or charcoal. If the ingredients of Thymiama 


are not procurable, a plentiful. supply of incense shall 
suffice. \ 


Holy water having been made in the usual way, the 
Bishop begins the Service with 


THE INVOCATION, 


In the Name of the Father, *h and of the Son, | 
and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 


The Bishop takes the aspergill and sprinkles the bell 
both outside and inside, saying:

the Sick, and therewith makes the sign of the cross four 
times upon the outside of the upper half of the bell, 
first wpon the north side, then (passing by the east) 
upon the south, then on the west side, and finally upon 
the east, saying: 
In the Name of the Most High, and invoking the 
aid of the holy Archangel Raphael, I anoint this bell 
for the healing of Christ’s faithful: followers, that 
whithersoever its sound may penetrate it may bear 
| help and strength both to soul and body, through Christ 
the Lord of heaven and earth. R. Amen. 


The Bishop intones the following prayer, moving round 
the bell and making the sign of the cross upon tt with 
the Oil of the Sick at the seven points indicated. ; 
| O Christ, Who art Thyself the great Exemplar of 
| all divine virtues, we pray Thee to pour down Thy 
blessing upon this bell, that its voice may arouse in 
the hearts of Thy loving children the discernment 
| clearly to perceive and the will humbly to copy Thy + 
| Strength, Thy + Wisdom, Thy + Lovingkind- 
‘ness, Thy + Beauty, Thy + Justice, Thy 
| + Devotion and Thy + Guiding Power, that so Thy

| may finally attain the glory which Thou hast ordained 
| for them, Thou Who livest and reignest with the 
| Father and the Holy Spirit, One God throughout the 
|ages of ages. R. Amen. k 
| The Bishop then takes wpon his thumb the sacred 
| Chrism, and therewith anoints the inside of the lip of 
| the bell at the four cardinal points, saying: 
| To the glory of + God Most High, and of His Ser- 
|vants + Mary Queen of Heaven, Blessed -+ Michael 
the Archangel and the holy + St.*......... I sol- 


* Tere is inserted the name of the Patron Saint of

service for ever, in the Name of the + Father, and of 
the + Son, and of the Holy + Ghost. BR. Amen. 


The Thymiama is then thrown upon the glowing char- 
coal in the brazier, and the latter is placed upon a stool 
under the bell. The Bishop intones: 


As the sweet savour fills this bell and rises up be- 
fore Thee, so pour Thou down, O Holy Spirit, the dew 
of Thy all-powerful blessing upon it and upon us Thy 
servants, Thou Who livest and reignest with the 
Father and Son, one God throughout the ages of ages.

you; the Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make

trowel, and spreads a layer of mortar where the stone is 
to be laid. The stone is lowered into its place, and 
turning to the subdeacon, he says: 


Is the stone plumb ?

plies:

nothing is strong, nothing is holy, look down in the 
might of Thy power upon this creature of stone, that 
it and this place, which we have dedicated to Thy 
service and consecrated to Thy work, may become 
radiant with the Light of Thy undying Fire. 


During the prayer which follows the Bishop anoints 
with chrism the cross carved on the face of the stone. 


Wherefore do we + bless and + hallow this stone 
as the foundation of Thy Church to the glory of God, 
to the perfecting of humanity, and in honour of *His 
glorious Martyr, the holy St.... In the name of 
the + Father, and of the + Son, and of the Holy + 
Ghost. R. Amen.

1. We are no more strangers and foreigners; but 
fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household 
of God; 

2. And are built upon the foundation of the apos- 
_tles and prophets: Jesus Christ Himself being the 
_chief Corner-stone; 


| 3. In Whom all the building fitly framed together; 
/groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord;

Church,

this seal: let everyone that nameth the Name of —

tion, that they may be bearers of thy love and joy 
to all their brethren, O Thou Who art the Master 
and Friend of all that lives. R. Amen.

benediction:

keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and 
love of God, and of His Son, Christ our Lord; and 
the blessing of God Almighty, the + Father, the + 
Son, and the Holy + Ghost, be amongst you, and 
remain with you always. R. Amen.
