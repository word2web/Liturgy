THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD 





The funeral rites of the Church may be grouped into 
two divisions; the first including those offices, foremost 
in importance, whose purpose it is to surround the liber- 
ated soul with peace and spiritual power. Of these the 
offering of the Holy Sacrifice for the repose of the soul 
is the most important and efficacious. The other and 
less important part of the rite consists in the hallowing 
of the grave and the consigning into it of the ashes or 
the cast-off body. To this must be added the work of 
giving comfort and assurance to the relatives and friends. 


This work of giving help and peace to the departed 
person is inevitably hindered if we surround him with 
feelings of depression and unhappiness. Every effort 
should therefore be made to put aside our own very: 
natural sense of sorrow and loss, and to think rather 
of the happiness and peace of the departed soul. In 
proportion as we can accomplish this, do we also gain 
comfort and strength for ourselves. 





The Priest should be asked to commemorate the de- 
ceased person, as soon after the death as possible, at one 
of his regular Celebrations. It is strongly recommend- 
ed that wherever possible the physical body of the de- 
ceased person shall be cremated, that is, disintegrated 


rapidly by fire rather than by process of slow decay. 


If there is to be a special Requiem Eucharist the body 


should if possible be taken to the church where that 


Eucharist is offered. 


After the death, tt is well that the body should be 
sprinkled by the relatives with holy water, either bless- 
ed specially by a Priest or obtained from the holy water 
stoup of a neighbouring church. The coffin should simi- 
larly be sprinkled before. the funeral procession leaves 
the house. The Absolution hereafter printed should be

performed as soon after the death as is convenient, un- 
less the deceased person received Absolution shortly be- 
fore death. It may be repeated at the burial service. 
In the case of a child of tender years the Absolution 
is omitted. y 





As the. burial customs vary in different countries 
and places, the clergy must use their discretion in re- 
arranging the several portions of the ceremony. Hymns 
may be introduced at suitable places, also addresses and 
readings from various sources. If the entire ceremony 
be found too long, those portions may be omitted to 
which an asterisk is prefixed. 


According to the arrangements made, the portion of 
this ceremony preceding the Burial itself will take 
place in the cemetery out-of-doors, in the cemetery chapel, 
in a funeral parlour, in a private house, or in the church. 

The Priest may etther accompany the funeral proces- 
sion or meet tt at the cemetery. 





As the body is carried through the cemetery or the 
church, some of the following passages are read by the 
Priest or chanted by the choir: 


I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: 
he that believeth in Me, though he were dead yet 
shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth 
in Me shall never die. 


*Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth: 
where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves 
break through and steal. 


But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven: 
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where 
thieves do not break through nor steal. 


For where your treasure is: there will your heart 
be also. 





*I know that my Redeemer liveth: Whom I shall 
see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold. : 


e 


“BURIAL OF THE DEAD 291 


_ *Be not deceived; God is ‘not mocked: for what- 
soever a'man soweth, that shall he also reap. 


For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the fiesh 
reap corruption: but he that soweth to the Spirit, 
shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. 


_ And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due 
season we shall reap, if we faint not. 


As we have therefore opportunity: let us do good 
unto all men. 

The souls of the righteous are in the hand of 
God: and there shall no torment touch them. 


In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, 
and their departure is taken for misery, and their 
going from us to be utter destruction: but they are 
in peace. 


For God created man to be immortal: and made 
him to be an image of His own eternity. 


Glory be to the Father and to the Son: and to 
the Holy Ghost. 


As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be: world without end. Amen. 


THE INVOCATION } 
When the Priest has arrived at the chancel or grave, 
and the above sentences are finished, he says: 


In the Name of the Father, > and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. 


THEH FIRST CHARGE 


He turns to the people and speaks as follows: 
Brethren, we are met together here to-day to cele- 
brate the passing into a higher life of our dear 
brother N. It is but natural that we who have 
known and loved him should regret his departure

292 BURIAL OF THE DEAD 


from amongst us; yet on this occasion it is our duty 
to think not of ourselves, but of him. Therefore. 
must we strenuously endeavour to lay aside the 
thought of our personal loss, and dwell only upon 
his great and most glorious gain. 


To this end I will call upon you to join with me 
in the recitation (or singing) of the Ze Deum (or- 
part of the twenty-third psalm).

THE ABSOLUTION 


During the following passages the Priest encompass: | 
es the body and sprinkles it with holy water thrice on 
either side, after which he again encompasses it and 
censes tt thrice on either side. If the body be not 
present, these ceremonies are omitted, but the words,’ 
nevertheless, are said. The Absolution is omitted in the’ 
case of young children. 







P. Rest in the eternal grant unto him, O Lord. 
C. And let light perpetual shine upon him. 


P. Come forth to meet him, ye Angels of th 
Lord. 


C.. Receive him into your fellowship, O ye saint 
of God. 


May the choirs of Angels receive him. 

And guide him into eternal peace. 

Rest in the eternal grant unto him, O Lord. 
And let light perpetual shine upon him.

BURIAL OF THE DEAD 295 


P. O God, in Whose unspeakable love the souls 
of the departed find rest and peace, in Thy Name 
we -+ absolve from every bond of sin Thy servant 
‘who has cast off this garment of fleshh May Thy 
holy Angels bear him in their tender care, that he 
may enter the brightness of the everlasting light 
and find his peace in Thee. Through Christ our 
Lord. R. Amen. 








THE COLLECTS 


The following Collects are recited, unless a spec- 
ial Requiem Eucharist is to be celebrated. In that event, 
the Eucharist begins, and the Collects will be said in 
the usual place therein. In the case of children, the words 
“*this Thy child’’ are used instead of ‘‘this Thy ser- 
vant.’? 

P. The Lord be with you. 

C. And with thy spirit. 


P. Let us pray. 

Almighty God, Who hast dominion over both the 
living and the dead, and dost hold all Thy creation 
in the everlasting arms of Thy love, we pray Thee 
for the peace and repose of Thy servant, that he, 
being dead unto this world, yet ever living unto 
Thee, may find in Thy continued and unceasing ser- 
vice the perfect consummation of happiness and 
peace. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen, 


P. Likewise, O Lord, we pray Thee for those who 
love Thy servant, those whom Thou hast called to 
sacrifice the solace of his earthly presence; do Thou, 
O Lord, comfort them with the balm of Thy loving- 
kindness, that, strengthened by Thee and resting 
upon the surety of Thy wisdom, they may put aside 
their thoughts of sorrow and grief, and pour out upon 
him only such thoughts of love as may help him in 
the higher life of service to which Thou hast now 
called him. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Epistle, Gospel and Communio from the Requiem 
Eucharist may follow here if desired. 





296 BURIAL OF THE DEAD 
THE BURIAL 


The procession bearing the coffin goes to the 
grave. Before the coffin is lowered the grave is sprinkled 
with holy water and censed. 





[In case of cremation, the wrn containing the ashes is 
sometimes buried in a grave, sometimes deposited in a 
niche. In the former case the same formalities are ob- 
served as with a coffin. In the latter, the niche 1s 
treated as the grave, save that, of course, earth is pot 
thrown therein. | 


The following prayer is said by the Priest: 


O God, Who in Thy providence hast appointed a 
wondrous ministry of Angels, we pray Thee to + 
hallow this grave, and send down Thy holy Angel 
from heaven to -+ bless and sanctify it. Througt 
Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


THE SECOND CHARGE 
The coffin is then lowered, as the Priest says: 


Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God o: 
His great love to take unto Himself our dear brothe 
hence departed, we therefore commit this his cast-of 
body to the ground, earth to earth (here some earti 
is cast upon the coffin by the Priest or someon 
standing by), ashes to ashes, dust to dust, that in 
that more glorious spiritual body which now jh 
weareth, he may be free from earthly chains t 
serve God as he ought. For I say unto you: Bles 
ed are the dead which die in the Lord; for the soul 
of the righteous are in the hand of God, and ther. 
Shuil no torment touch them. In the sight of th 
unwise they seem to die, and their departure i 
taken for misery, and their going from us to b 
utter destruction, but they are in peace. For Go 
created man to be immortal, and made him to be a 
image of His own eternity. The Lord sitteth abov 
the waterfloods; the Lord remaineth a King fo 
ever. The universe is His temple; wisdom, streng 






















BURIAL OF THE DEAD 297 


and beauty are about His throne as Pillars of His 
works; for His wisdom is infinite, His Strength is om- 
nipotent, and His beauty shines through the whole 
universe in order and symmetry. The heavens He 
| has Stretched forth as a canopy; the earth He has 
| planted as His footstool; He crowns His temple with 
‘stars as with a diadem, and from His hands flow 
Jall power and glory. The sun and the moon are 
imessengers of His will, and all His law is concord. 
If we ascend up into heaven, He is there; if we go 
jdown into hell, He is there also. If we take the 
jwings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost 
jparts of the sea, even there also His hand shall 
in us, and His right hand shall hold us. In His 


4 





almighty care we rest in perfect peace, and equally 
in His care rests this our loved one, whom He has 
ideigned to draw nearer to the vision of His eternal 
beauty. 


Ever praising Him therefore, in firm but humble 
«confidence we call upon Him and say: 


O Father of Light, in Whom is no darkness at all, 
e pray Thee to fill our hearts with calm and 
peace, and to open within us the eyes of the soul, 
hat we may see by faith the radiance and the glory 
hat Thou art pouring upon us Thy servants. For 
hou ever givest us far more than we can ask or 
hink, and it is only through our feebleness and 
faithlessness that we ever need crave anything from 
[Thine omnipotence. But Thou knowest well the 
weakness of the human heart, and in Thy limitless 
ove Thou wilt make allowance for our human love 
hen we beseech Thee to grant eternal rest unto 
ie our dear brother, and that light perpetual may 
Whine upon him. We thank thee that in Thy loving 
rovidence Thou hast drawn him from the unreal 
wards the Real, from the darkness of earth into 
hy glorious light, through the gates of death into a 
lendour beyond our comprehension. Our loving 
fhought shall follow and surround him; O take Thou 
is our gift of thought, imperfect though it be, and 





298 BURIAL OF THE DEAD 


touch it with the eternal Fire of Thy love, so thai 
it may become for him a guardian Angel to hely 
him on his upward way. Thus through Thy loving 
kindness may we in deep humility and reverence be 
come fellow-workers with Thy boundless power, ant 
may our weakness be supported by Thine infinit 
strength; that we, with this our dearly-beloves 
brother, may in due time attain unto the wisdon 
of the Spirit, Who with the Father and the So: 
liveth and reigneth, God throughout all ages of ages 
R. Amen. 


The followwg prayer may be added: 

*P, Almighty God, in Whose light do live th 
souls of them that depart hence in the Lord, an 
with Whom the faithful, after they are delivere 
from the burden of the flesh, are in joy and felicity 
we give Thee hearty thanks, for that it hath please 
Thee to deliver this our brother out of the miserie 
of this mortal world, and do pray Thee that we ma 
be found worthy, together with all those that ai 
departed in the true faith of Thy holy Name, * 
stand before Thee hereafter in the ranks of Thy gloi 
ous Church triumphant. . Through Christ our Lor 
R. Amen. 


P. yy May the souls of all the departed throug 
the love of God rest in peace. R., Amen, 


P. yy The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, ant 
the love of God, and the fellowship of the He 
Ghost be with us all evermore. R. Amen.
