THE CONSECRATION OF A 
CHURCH 





Lhe clergy and acolytes enter the chancel singing a 
hymn, and group themselves around the Altar, which is 
uncovered and unadorned. 


THE INVOCATION 


Bishop. In the Name of the Father, yy and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 

A short address appropriate to the occasion may be 
given by the Bishop, or by one of the clergy appointed 
‘or the purpose; or the homily which follows may be 
‘ead. 

Tt is the immemorial custom of holy Church to con- 
ecrate the building in which her services are per- 
anently to be held; and it is for this purpose that 
© are met together to-day. Our first step in this 

remony is to endeavour to purify the mental at- 
nosphere of the building by the use of holy water 

d of incense, so that worldly thought and infiu- 
ne may be banished: from it; and our thoughts dur- 
g our first procession should be devoted to that end. 
laving performed the ritual of purification, we call 
pon Almighty God to consecrate and to hallow all 
is various parts to the purposes in His service for 
hich they are destined, and to that end we anoint 
ith holy oil certain special centres of influence. In 
at second procession of consecration our minds 
ould be strongly fixed upon the idea that this 
ourch shall be not only a place free from selfish or 
prldly thought, but definitely an active centre of 

od and holy thought—not | merely free from evil, 
¢ actively good. When this great act of consecra- 

m has been duly performed, we at once begin our 

+ Service—the highest and holiest Service that 

know—the Holy Eucharist which Christ Himself 
fained. In the course of this celebration the third 
ocession will take place, and the sacred Host ‘will

be borne round the Church as a crowning benedic- 
tion. During that time our hearts should be filled 
with deepest adoration to our Lord and with heartiest 
thankfulness for His wondrous love. Remember, 
then, these three keynotes of the different portions of 
the Service—first purification, secondly consecration, 
and thirdly adoration and thankfulness. |

and with his thumb makes the sign of the cross with 
chrism upon the five crosses carved upon the Altar-stone 
(or upon the Altar itself if it be made of stone). He 
then anoints the cross of the tabernacle (or the Altar 
cross) with chrism, and says: 


O God, Whose wisdom mightily and sweetly order- 
eth all things, look down, we pray Thee, upon the 
handiwork of Thy servants, and fill this house with

THE EPISTLE 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the twenty-first chapter of the Revelation 
of St. John the Divine, beginning at the second verse. 


AND I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, 
coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a 
bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great 
voice out of heaven saying: Behold, the tabernacle 
of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, 
and they shall be His people, and God Himself. shall 
be with them, and be their God. And God shall 
wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall 
be-no more death, neither Sorrow, nor crying, neither 
shall there be any more. pain: for the former things 
are passed away. And He that sat upon the throne 
said: Behold, I make all things new. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 
THE GOSPEL 


The holy Gospel is taken from the fourteenth chapter 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the sixth 
verse. 


JESUS said: I am the Way, the Truth and the 
Life; no man cometh unto the Father but by Me. 
He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; for I 
am in the Father, and the Father in Me. I and My 
Father are one; as the Father hath loved Me, so have 
I loved you; and this is My commandment, that ye 
love one another, as I have loved you. When the 
Comforter is come, Whom I will send unto you from 
the Father, even the Spirit of Truth, Which pro- 
ceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of Me. And

ye also shall bear witness, because ye have beni with 
Me from the beginning. By this shall all men know 
that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to an- 
other. 5

After the procession returns to the chancel, the Hu- 
charistic service is continued to the. end. 





When tt is desirable to use a Church before the Bishop | 
can conveniently attend to consecrate it, the Priest should | 


Use 


the Collect of Purification (p. 386), sprinkling the 


Altar and Church with holy water, and then the Collect 


of Consecration (p. 387). The Altar-stone must have | 
been blessed by a Bishop.
