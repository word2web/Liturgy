THE CONFERRING OF MINOR ORDERS 


The degrees from Cleric to Acolyte inclusive may be 
conferred apart from the celebration of the Holy Euchar- 
ist; but only in the morning, except in the case of 
Cleric, which may be gwen at any hour. Tf, however, 
they are given during the Eucharist, the ordination to 
the degree of Cleric shall take place after the Intrott, 
and to the other four degrees after the Kyrie.
