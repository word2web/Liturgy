THE ADMISSION OF A SINGER 





The Priest stands at the foot of the Altar steps, 
the candidate standing before him. 


Priest. In the Name of the Father, 44 and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 


P. Since you are now to be admitted as a Singer 
in Christ’s holy Church, let me exhort you to be 
mindful of the duties of your office. It is impera- 
tive, as you doubtless understand, that you should 
be punctual and regular in your attendance 
at Church, and not lightly excuse yourself from your 
duties. Also that you should work in the spirit of 
co-operation with your fellow-members of the choir, 
showing unfailing courtesy, patience and tact. But 
above all, both in the Church and out of it, remem- 
ber the sacredness of speech. Man is endowed with 
many faculties, and all of them should be used in the 
service of God. From time immemorial, however, 
the voice has been regarded as the especial instru- 
ment for rendering praise and glory to Almighty 
God. It is indeed very meet, right, and our bounden 
duty that we, in company with the angelic host, should 
give thanks unto Him Whose Name is holy and Who 
filleth the whole earth with His majesty and glory. 
And as you come before Him with a song upon your 
lips, see to it that you also make melody in your 
heart, joining in the great song of life which is 
the ceaseless hymn of all creation. Let your work, 
then, be done in the spirit of service, not with vain- 
gloriousness and pride of self, but rather in single- 
ness of heart. So shall the blessing of the Christ 
rest upon you, and inspire both your voice and your 
heart. 


The candidate now kneels before the Priest. 


P Wilt thou strive earnestly to practise these 
duties ? 


Candidate. I will.

P. The Lord keep thee in all these things, well-be- 


_ loved son, and strengthen thee in all goodness. R. 


Amen, 


The Priest says the following prayer with hands ea- 
tended towards the candidate: 


O Lord Christ, Who art ever ready to receive and 
to strengthen the earnest aspirations of Thy chil- 
dren, look down in Thy love upon this Thy servant 
who desires to minister as a Singer in Thy holy 
Church. Sanctify + him, O Lord, with Thy heaven- 
ly grace, and so fill his heart with heavenly music 
that his life may resound with Thy praise. R. Amen. 


The Priest lays his hand upon the candidate’s 
head, raising it only to make the sign of the cross, and 
says: 

The blessing of God Almighty, the Father, + the 
Son, and the Holy Ghost, come down upon thee, that 
thou mayest rightly fulfil that which to-day thou hast 
undertaken. R. Amen,
