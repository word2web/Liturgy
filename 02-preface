PREFACE 


Some brief explanation of the principles which have 

. guided the writing of this Liturgy of the Liberal 

Catholic Church may help the reader to understand 
its spirit and aim. 


It will be seen that the word Liturgy, as applied 
- to this book, is not restricted to the Order of the cele- 
bration of the Holy Eucharist, as in the Hastern 
Church. It is applied, rather, to the entire order of 
public worship and administration of the Sacraments, 
officially authorized—such, indeed, as would usually be 
described by the adjective ‘‘liturgical’’—as distinct 
from public or private devotions, services of preach- 
ing and praise, extempore worship and so forth, which 
may be permitted but are not prescribed. 


The movement from which the Liberal Catholic 
Church originated used the Roman Liturgy, but the 
complete re-organization of the movement upon its 
present basis of the widest freedom involved a corres- 
pondingly drastic revision of the Liturgy. The Roman 
Liturgy was chosen as the basis for that revision. As 
all students of the subject are aware, the Roman Liturgy 
is a composite product, derived from a variety of an- 
cient sources. It appears to have grown up by a pro- 
cess of absorption, and notably by the absorption of 
a widespread Gallican use, which in its turn had 
oriental affiliations. It bears all the marks of this 
antiquity and composite structure. Antiquity, in this 
case, carries with it both advantages and disadvantages. 
It carries us nearer to the stream of pure tradition 
emanating from the Christ Himself—but within what 
distance’ we do not know. But it also carries us back 
to a culture immeasurably more limited than ours. 
Many of the earlier communities of Christians appear 
to have been at quite a low level of development, such 
as those Corinthians to whom St. Paul addressed his 
Epistle. If we glance critically at one of the earlier 
liturgies known to history—the Sacramentary of Sara-

pion—we soon discover that the fragments therein pre- 
served reflect an outlook naturally to be expected among 
a primitive agricultural community. The Roman Lit-. 
urgy, too, suffers on account of its very antiquity; des- 
pite, and maybe in some ways because of, its various 
recensions. 


Rendered in Latin, its frequent crudity of concep- 
tion commonly escapes detection, but a critical examin- 
ation of its meaning speedily shows how ill-suited it 
is to modern use, and this judgment is apt to be height- 
ened by the evident difficulty of translating the well- 
rounded Latin in which it is cast into the English 
tongue, and by the uncouth rendering which would seem 
to have been adopted by its various translators almost 
of set purpose, as though to emphasize the inferiority of 
the vernacular as a vehicle of liturgical expression. 


The Roman Liturgy, moreover, is full of expressions 
which indicate fear of God, of His wrath and of the 
prospect of everlasting hell; and these in their turn 
evoke other expressions of servile cringing .and self- 
abasement, abject appeals for merey, even culminating 
in. naive attempts to bargain with the Almighty. The 
evil is so patent to anyone who pauses to look for it, 
that a couple of specimens of this language will suffice 
by way of illustration. ‘‘We therefore beseech Thee, 
O Lord, to be appeased and to receive this offering....; 
grant that we may be rescued from eternal damn- 
ation.....’? ‘‘Hear us, O God of. our salvation, 
and deliver Thy people from the terrors of divine anger, 
and make them secure by the bountifulness. of Thy 
merey.’’ It ought to be impossible for thinking men 
of our day to have to repeat this crude anthropomorph- 
ism. In one sense, of course, all our conceptions of 
God. must inevitably be anthropomorphic. Whatever 
we think of Him is the product of the human mind; 
whatever, indeed, has been revealed to us concerning 
the Divine Nature is set in terms capable of being 
grasped by our finite minds. Still, it is a fair canon 
to demand that He shall be interpreted in terms of that 
which is best and noblest in our human nature, and not 
in terms of that which is worst, and of which we our-

selves are ashamed. The Roman Liturgy is the worst 
offender in these respects, but the Anglican Liturgy also, 
though much less crude, is far from blameless. The 
Greek Liturgies are very much less overcast with this 
greyness of fear and gloom; they dwell more on the 
love of God. 

In this Liberal Catholic Church these disfiguring ele- 
ments have been eliminated, as derogatory alike to the 
idea of a loving Father and to the men whom He has 
ereated in His own image. If Christians had been 
content to take what Christ taught of the Father in 
heaven, they would never have saddled themselves with 
the jealous, angry, bloodthirsty Jehovah of Ezra, 
Nehemiah and the others—a god who needs propitiating 
and to whose ‘‘mercy’’ constant appeals must be 
made. Moreover, the knowledge of Eastern religions, 
arid of the faiths of ancient Egypt and Babylon, that 
has increasingly become available in our times, has en- 
tirely dispelled the illusion that the Jews had any mon- 
opoly of divine truth. and proportionately lessens the 
value of the Old Testament as an integral basis of the 
Christian faith. 

On the same principle our Liturgy rejects the impre- 
cations of the heathen and passages of cursing that 
- are so characteristic, unfortunately, alike of the Psalms 
and of the history of the Christian Church. Their use 
is totally foreign to the spirit of Christ, and while 
they may have been less inexcusable in days of perse- 
cution and internecine strife, Christianity no longer has 
place for them. It is, indeed, difficult to pick out more 
than a handful of Psalms unmarred in their entirety ~ 
by such passages. Hence, with a view to preserving 
for our worship language and sentiments that are sub- 
lime, and at the same time escaping this  diffi- 
culty, we have been emboldened to _ construct 
psalms, epistles and gospels, by a system of 
cento selection. We are well aware that apologists 
contend that the passages and sentiments to which we 
take exception are susceptible of another and gentler 
interpretation. Thus the wrath of God means the ill- 
consequences that inevitably attend a breach of His 
laws. Such explanations, while they soften the asper- 





10 : PREFACE 





ity of the original passages, read like the special plead- 
ings of people who are tied to a liturgy or to a view of 
Seripture that is obsolete; and in any case do not Te- 
move the objection that the passages convey a false im- 
pression. 


The composite structure of the Roman Liturgy is also 
evident to the student in the overlapping with which it 
abounds, particularly in the baptismal and ordination 
services, and in the occurrence of phrases that bear slight. 
relation to their context or accompanying manual ae- 
tions, or sometimes little meaning at all. These are 
attributable to a process of what we may eall ‘‘tele- 
scoping’’ one liturgy into another, with the result that, 
for example, when a certain action of the rite has duly 
been performed, according to the sequence of one lit- 
urgy, prayers from another rite then follow, having 
the effect of reiterating the request for its perform: 
ance. Some commentators recognize these inconsist- 
encies; others appear to explain them as ‘‘ dramatic 
anticipations’’ or ‘ ‘postponements,’’ or as indicating 
a period of thought when the precise moment of an ac. 
tion was not defined, or even by the simple expedient 
of remarking that it takes time to say things. 


Another recurring element of the older liturgies is 
that of petition for personal and temporal advantages. Our 
Lord taught us very definitely the virtue of confidence 
in the ‘‘Good Law’’; that not a sparrow falls to the 
ground without the knowledge of our heavenly Father. 
We have sought to interpret the spirit of our age by 
substituting joyous aspirational utterance for such tem- 
poral petition, and encouraging our worshippers to for- 
get themselves—indeed, to find their truc selves—in 
thoughtfulness for others. 


It has been a wrench to lay aside many familiar pas- 
sages, round which have clustered a multitude of happy 
memories. Yet it is clear that long continued use and 
happy associations, especially those of childhood, will 
deaden the mind to sentiments that are indefensible. 
This is eminently true of popular hymns, where the 
music also tends to obscure the words. In thus giving 


PREFACE 11 





the head precedence over the heart, we may find conso- 
lation in the fact that we write for a new generation, 
who, have no such associations. Moreover, it is signi- 
ficant that in newer countries, like the Antipodes and the 
United States of America, where numbers of people 
have grown up without bible or Church, the judgment 
at once condemns such passages. The most conserva- 
tive among us may wonder how people can gravely sing: 


Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee 

Repaid a thousand-fold will be; 

Then gladly we will give to Thee, 
Who givest all. 


In the Gloria in Excelsis, the phrase ‘‘ Lamb of God’’ 
has been eliminated, as such zoological characterization 
of our Lord does not impress the virgin mind with any- 
thing but a sense of the ridiculous. Once in the Canon, 
where the symbology of the allusion is explained, the 
phrase has been kept. 


We were disappointed to find the Greek Liturgies 
quite unsuitable for use in our work of revision. To 
define clearly the element which renders them thus un- 
suitable is difficult. It is somewhat similar, perhaps, 
to that which distinguishes the outlook of some nations 
from that of others. Some Celtic poets, for example, 
may be accused of a tendency to lapse into language 
that sounds beautiful, regardless of its meaning any- 
thing in particular. So in Latin countries one finds 
people apt to pay more attention to the manner of say- 
ing a thing than to the value of the thing said. On 
the other hand, the scientist will often express his facts 
in language that is precise and accurate, but with no 
thought for beauty of utterance or for the larger ideas 
which in the scheme of things lie behind the minor in- 
vestigations he has recorded. The Greek Liturgies 
come before us like a sea of beautiful language, but 
they do not appear to be constructed on any framework 
whatever of coherent and consecutive thought. The 
same applies in a measure to the Roman Liturgy, 
though the wealth and profusion of language is here 
wanting. Now, the actions of the Holy Eucharist (and, 


12 PREFACE 





indeed, of certain other services) are part of a defin- 
ite scheme of symbolism and efficacy. Beautiful language 
serves to stir people to devotion, though often that de- 
votion is vague; but if the co-operation of the mind 
can also be enlisted, the effect will obviously be greater 
not only on the individual worshipper, but on the re- 
sulting process as a whole. We have tried in this 
Liturgy to present, as it were, a new facet of these 
things, and while clothing our thought in language that 
is stately and beautiful, to make that thought corres- 
pond with the sequence of action. 


Many ceremonies of the older liturgies are interest- 
ing from the archeological standpoint; but it has been 
no part of our purpose to retain archeology for the sake 
of archeology. As we find a vernacular liturgy to be 
provocative of an infinitely greater response from our 
congregations than the use of Latin, so in other re- 
spects also we have studied efficiency in preference to 
archeological interest, believing that the truest rever- 
ence is shown by best helping the people for, whose 
worship the Liturgy is written, 


It is intended that the public worship should be 
‘‘congregational’’ in character. The ‘‘priesthood of 
the laity’’ is no empty phrase, and expression should 
be given to the truth which it embodies. There is 
evidence that originally the Holy Eucharist was more 
of a corporate act of worship than it came to be in 
later days when the laity could neither read nor follow 
the Latin. With the spread of education, the growth 
of intelligence, and the advantage of a vernacular lit- 
urgy, there is no reason at all why the laity should ‘‘as- 
sist’’ at the Holy Eucharist in the capacity of passive 
spectators only, or be debarred from following step by 
step what is taking place at the Altar. Liturgy means 
“public work or service,’’ not merely in the sense of 
work done by the public, but also of work for, or 
on behalf of, the publie at large. It is significant, 
too, that the termination of the word is related etymo- 
logically to our ‘‘urge’’ or ““energy.’? 


In our conception, worship has a threefold aspect 
and purpose. It is firstly the offering of “‘‘worth- 





PREFACE 13 





ship’’—that is, praise and honour—to Almighty God. 
Secondly, it is intended to help the worshippers. And 
thirdly—most important of all—it is intended to help 
the surrounding world at large, through the instrumen- 
tality of the worshippers, by pouring out upon it a 
great flood of spiritual power. We may safely say that 
God Himself does not need our praise, and certainly 
would not appreciate anything in the nature of adula- 
tion from those who might be expected to know better. 
We feel and know, on the other hand, that it is good 
for us to lift up our hearts in praise and aspiration, and 
to strive to unify ourselves more completely with the 
divine will, But we may go further and say with 
all reverence that God does make use of our co-opera- 
tion, and in His plan counts on that intelligent and en- 
ergetic co-operation more and more as man grows into 
spiritual maturity. The Liberal Catholic Church aims 
at making its members strong and efficient workers in 
His service. It tries to help them to realize the di- 
vine Light in themselves—the Light which lighteth 
every man that cometh into the world, but which too 
often is veiled and hidden by ignorance and wrong- 
doing—and then to see that Light in the heart of 
others, and to help them to unveil its divine splendour. 

It remains for us to acknowledge indebtedness to 
other liturgies. As already explained, the Roman 
Liturgy has been our model. In its passage through 
the ages it has preserved the dramatic symbolism and 
manual acts of the various rites with remarkable fidel- 
ity. From the Liturgy of St. Chrysostom we have 
adapted the well-known prayer used in the Anglican 
Church, and a number of beautiful phrases which 
have been combined into the prayer in our Eucharist, 
‘“‘Unto Thee, O Perfect One.’’ We have availed our- 
selves of many sentences and collects from the Angli- 
ean Book of Common Prayer. - That book was an at- 
tempt, like ours, to revise and simplify the Roman 
Liturgy. Of parts of it we may enthusiastically echo 
the words of an Anglican prelate who spoke of it as 
‘¢our incomparable liturgy,’’ for the stateliness and 
virility of its English are unmatched. Unfortunately 
its Communion Office is sadly disarranged, and is shorn 


14 PREFACE 





of the richness of the older rites, so much so that it has 
been described as ‘‘the baldest Eucharistic rite im 
Christendom,’’ and numbers of earnest Anglican Priests 
find it desirable to re-introduce thereinto a considerable 
portion of the Roman rite. The ‘‘authorized version’’ of 
the Scriptures has for the most part been used, for al- 
though the ‘‘revised version’’ is certainly a more faithful 
rendering of the original, it still leaves so much to be de- 
sired as not to compensate, in our opinion, for the loss 
of the majestic English of the King James’ version. 
We have followed Roman precedent in omitting from 
their context verses not germane to the main purpose 
of the Epistles and Gospels. Finally, we are in- 
debted to the beautiful Liturgy of the ‘‘Catholic 
Apostolic’? or so-called ‘‘Irvingite’’ Church for a few 
stately sentences incorporated in our rites of Ordina- 
tion, and for one prayer in our Consecration of a Church. 
Two sentences in the Holy Hucharist beginning ‘‘Un- 
der the veil of earthly things’’ come from a source 
that we are unable to trace. 


The rubrics are designed to indicate sufficiently to 
the people the sequence of the ceremonies, that they, 
may follow what is taking place. For the Priest more 
detailed instructions are issued. 


[The General Information and Preface, together with 
most of the Notes preceding each of the Services in this 
Book, are the work of our first Presiding Bishop, the 
Right Reverend James Ingall Wedgwood, to whom the 
Liberal Catholic Church owes a debt of the deepest 
gratitude. To his wide erudition and his indefatigable 
labours the compilation of this Liturgy is due.
