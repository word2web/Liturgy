*All kneel, and say:*

O Lord, Thou hast created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of Thine own eternity; yet often we forget the glory of our heritage, and wander from the path which leads to righteousness. But Thou, O Lord, hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts are ever restless till they find their rest in Thee. Look with the eyes of Thy love upon our manifold imperfections, and pardon all our shortcomings, that we may be filled with the brightness of the everlasting light, and become the unspotted mirror of Thy power and the image of Thy goodness. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

Thou art my lamp, O Lord.

2. But Thy candle, O Lord, shineth upon my head: and by Thy light I walk through the darkness.  
3. Thou hast brought us out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death: and broken our bonds in sunder.  
4. Yea, the darkness is no darkness with Thee, but the night is as clear as the day: the darkness and the light to Thee are both alike.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.  
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.

*Antiphon*  
Thou art my lamp, O Lord.  
The Lord will lighten my darkness.

He hath called us out of darkness.  
Into His marvellous light.

1. Who is there that walketh in darkness: and hath no light?  
2. Let him trust in the Lord: and stay upon his God.  
3. Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the darkness: he is merciful, loving and righteous.  
4. I am the Light of the world, saith the Lord: he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.

**P.** O God, from Whom all holy desires, all good counsels and all just works do proceed; give unto Thy servants that peace which the world cannot give; both that our hearts may be set to obey Thy commandments, and that by Thee we being defended from the fear of all evil may pass this night in rest and quietness. Through Christ our Lord.  
**R.** Amen.

**P.** Almighty God, the Protector of all who trust in Thee, send forth Thy power to keep us this night both outwardly in our bodies and inwardly in ourselves; that so far as is expedient for us we may be defended from all adversities which may happen to the body, and from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul. Through Christ our Lord.  
**R.** Amen.

**P.** Teach us, O Lord, to see Thy life in all men and in all the peoples of Thine earth, and guide our nation through its leaders to preserve Thy peace, that the menace of war be far from our days, through Christ our Lord.
