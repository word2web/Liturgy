SERMONS. 


When sermons are preached in connection with any of 
the services it is recommended that they should in all 
cases be preceded by the Invocation: In the Name of 
the Father +} and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. 
k. Amen, and shall be immediately followed by the fol- 
lowing ascription of glory to the Blessed Trinity: 


And now to God the Father, God the Son, and God 
the Holy Ghost, Three Persons in one God,.be ascribed, 
as is most justly due, all honour, might, majesty, power 
and dominion, henceforth and for evermore. R. Amen. 





CORRECTION. 

At bottom of p. 358, substitute for: He joins the 
consecrated hands and binds them with a linen strip, the 
following: He joins the consecrated hands, the right 
resting on the left, and they are placed in a linen cloth 
which is suspended from his neck. 

It should be understood that any member of the 
congregation who prefers to kneel all through a Low 
Celebration is permitted to do so.

THE BLESSING OF A HOUSE. | 


After the Priest has formally entered the house and 
given the word of peace, he turns and draws a line with 
holy water before the door, and says:

Thy mighty power that those who enter through it may 
leave behind them all unworthy thought and feeling, 
that Thy children who dwell in this house may ever 
serve Thee in peace and holiness of life, through Christ 
our Lord. R. Amen. 


He then goes to all the other entrances to the house, 
and draws a line of holy water before each, repeating 
the same prayer. After this he proceeds to sprinkle 
and cense the rooms as prescribed. 


Let it be noted that the Eucharist of the Presanctified 
to be used on Good Friday and Holy Saturday shall 
commence with the Asperges in the Shorter Form, but 
omitting the words: 


He will send His holy Angel to build for us a spir- 
itual temple through which
