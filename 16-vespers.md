VESPERS 


x | Vespers is one of the ancient canonical hours of the 
Church, or portions of the Divine Office recited as an 


act of devotion. These are: Matins, Lauds, Prime, 
Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, Complin. Vespers has 
become the most popular of these, being well adapted 
to use as a public evening service. 

The Psalms, heralded by the key-thoughts of their re- 
spective antiphons, serve to attune the mind to the glory 


of the Deity. The Little Chapter and Hymn intro- 


duce other notes. Then the whole culminates in the 
great outpouring of praise at the Te Deum, and comes 
to a fitting conclusion in the peace and calm of the Col- 
lects and final versicles. 

The service follows somewhat closely the structure of 
the Latin original, but the component matter is differ- 
ent. The Psalms, for example, are a cento. 





THE INVOCATION 


The people stand. - 

Priest. In the Name of the Father, »4 and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 

After the Priest has reached the sedilia the service 
proceeds as follows: 
. Our help is in the Name of the Lord. 
Who hath made heaven and earth. 
. Trust ye in the Lord for ever. 
For He is our Rock of Ages. 
. Blessed are the pure in heart. 
For they shall see God. 
. The Lord be with you. 
, And with thy spirit. 

All. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to 
the Holy Ghost. 

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be: world without end. Amen.

All are seated. ; : 

The Priest alone (or a cantor appointed by him) in 
all cases sings the first half of the first verse of each of 
the Psalms, the choir and people joining in at the second 
half. 

In order to avoid tiring the voices of the people, it 
is usual to sing the Psalms antiphonally , one half of the 
choir and people (generally those on the epistle side) 
singing the verses with odd numbers, and the other half 
those with even numbers. All join in the Gloria.

P. Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of 
God, and everyone that loveth is born of God, and 
knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; 
for God is love. And this commandment have we from 
Him, that he who loveth God love his brother also. 


C. Thanks be to God. 
HYMN ; 
O Trinity of burning light, 
Shine Thou within our hearts this night; 
The fiery sun sinks in the west, 
Grant us in Thee in peace to rest, 


To Thee our morning song of praise, 
To Thee our evening hymn we raise; 
Thy love supernal we adore, 
For ever and for evermore.
