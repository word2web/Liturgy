THE LITURGY OF THE HOLY 
EUCHARIST 


ASPERGES 


The shorter form of the Asperges, as given on page 
192, may be substituted for the following when it is 
thought desirable. 


The Priest, with his assistants, kneels before the 
Altar; he intones the words, ‘‘Thou shalt sprinkle me’? 
and *‘T will lift up mine eyes unto the hills,’? and the 
remainder of the Antiphon and Psalm is taken up by 
the choir and congregation, who stand. 

Meanwhile the Priest sprinkles with holy water the 
Altar and himself, then the clergy and the people, who 
bow and cross themselves. 


PSALM 121 
Antiphon* 


Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, O Lord, and 
I shall be clean: Thou shalt wash me, and I shall 
be whiter than snow. 


1. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills: from 
whence cometh my help. 


2. My help cometh even from the Lord: Who hath 
made heaven and earth. 


8. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and 
He that keepeth thee will not sleep. 





*The antiphon consists of one or more verses sung 
before and after a psalm, with a view of summarizing 
and bringing into prominence the central idea of the 
psalm. The word means “singing against, or in re- 


sponse,’’ and refers to the manner of singing these ~ 


passages, which was by way of interpolation  be- 
tween the verses of the psalm in ancient days when 
the people could not read, 


HOLY BHUUHANISLT Ce aie 


Pos eS 
4, Behold, He that keepeth Israel: shall neither 
slumber nor sleep. : 


5. The Lord Himself is thy keeper: the Lord is thy 
defence upon thy right hand. 


6. So that the sun shall not smite thee by day: 
neither the moon by night. 


7. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: yea, 
it is even He that shall keep thy soul. 


8. The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy 
coming in: from this time forth for evermore. 


Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the 
Holy Ghost. 


As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be: world without end. Amen. 
Antiphon : 


Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, O Lord, and 
I shall be clean: ‘Thou shalt wash me, and I shall 
be whiter than snow. 


Priest. O Lord, open Thou our lips. 


Congregation. And our mouth shall show forth thy 
praise. 


P. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? 


Cc. Even he that hath clean hands and a pure 
heart. 


P. The Lord be with you. 
c. And with thy spirit. 
Pp. Let us pray. 

The people kneel. 


THE COLLECT

to serve and to worship Thee. Through Christ our 
Lord. . R. Amen.

the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. BR. Amen. 

The following Antiphon and Canticle are sung by all

CONFITEOR 

All Ieneel, and say together: 

O Lord, Thou hast created man to be immortal, and 
made him to be an image of Thine own eternity; 
yet often we forget the glory of our heritage, and 
wander from the path which leads to righteousness. 
But Thou, O Lord, hast made us for Thyself, and our 
hearts are ever restless till they find their rest in 
Thee. Look with the eyes of Thy love upon our mani- 
fold imperfections, and pardon all our shortcomings, 
that we may be filled with the brightness of the ever- 
lasting light, and become the unspotted mirror of Thy 
power and the image of Thy goodness. Through 
Christ our Lord. Amen. ; 

THE ABSOLUTION 

P. God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, 
pless, + preserve and sanctify you; the Lord in His 
lovingkindness look down upon you and be gracious 
unto you; the Lord > absolve you from all your 
sins, and grant you the grace and comfort of the 
Holy Spirit. R. Amen. 

The people are seated.

THE CENSING 

The censer is brought to the Priest who puts incense 
into it and blesses it saying: ; 

Mayest thou be blessed by Him in Whose honour 
thou shalt be burned. 

The Priest censes the Altar, after which the people 
stand. 

P. The Lord be with you.* 

C. And with thy spirit. 





INTROIT 

The Introit is sung by all together. 

4 Blessed be the Holy Trinity, the undivided 
Unity, eternal, immortal, invisible, to Whom be hon- 
our and glory for ever and ever. Amen, O Lord 
our God, how excellent is Thy Name in all the 
world. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and 
to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, 
and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Blessed 
be the Holy Trinity, the undivided Unity, eternal, im- 
mortal, invisible, to Whom be honour and glory for 
ever and ever. Amen. 

KYRIE}+ 


The Kyrie is sung by all together, the people kneel- 
ing. (At Low Celebration it is said alternately by Priest 
and people as hereunder indicated.) 

P. Kyrie eleison. 

C. Kyrie eleison. 

P. Kyrie eleison. 

*This ‘minor benediction, ’’ frequently repeated as 
the service proceeds, is designed to draw the Priest and 
people together into closer relation. 

t The usual translation of the phrases of the Kyrie, 
which are part of the ancient Greek Liturgy, is “¢Lord, 
have merey upon us,’? ‘Christ have merey upon Us, 
“‘Lord, have merey upon us.’? This conveys. a some- 
what wrong impression. The Greek word is akin to 





‘“eleemosynary,’’ and might even be rendered <é pour - 


forth Thy love upon us,’’ It indicates a dependence of 
love.

GLORIA IN EXCELSIS 


This is sung by all together, the people standing. The 
head is bowed at the words ‘‘we worship Thee,’’ ‘‘we 
gwe thanks to Thee,’’ and ‘‘receive our prayer.’’ 


Glory be to God in the highest, and on earth peace 
to men of good will. We praise Thee, we bless Thee, 
we worship Thee, we glorify Thee; we give thanks 
to Thee for Thy great glory, O Lord God, Heavenly 
King, God the Father Almighty. 

O Lord Christ, alone-born* of the Father; O Lord 
God, Indwelling Light, Son of the Father, Whose wis- 
dom mightily and sweetly ordereth all things, pour 
forth Thy love; Thou Whose strength upholdeth and 
sustaineth all creation, receive our prayer; Thou 
Whose beauty shineth through the whole universe, un- 
veil Thy glory. 

For Thou only art holy; Thou only art the Lord; 
Thou only, O Christ, with the Holy Ghost, art 
most high in the glory of God the Father. Amen. 

P. The Lord be with you. 

C. And with thy spirit. 

P. Let us pray. 


The people kneel. 
THE COLLECTS 

P. Almighty God, unto Whom all hearts be open, 
all desires known, and from Whom no secrets are hid; 
cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration 
of Thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love Thee, 
and worthily magnify Thy holy Name. Through Christ 
our Lord. R. Amen.

178 HOLY EUCHARIST 


Here follow the Collect of the Day and other Collects 
if any, and finally this Collect for Peace. 


P. Teach us, O Lord, to see Thy life in all men and 
in all the peoples of Thine earth, and guide our 
nation through its leaders to preserve Thy peace, 
that the menace of war be far from our days, through 
Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


THE EPISTLE 


The people are seated. At High Celebration the 
Epistle is read by the subdeacon (or a separate Epis- 
toller may be appointed). 

The Epistle ended, all stand and sing: 

Thanks be to God. 


THE GRADUAL 


All sing the Gradual (except that as usual the Priest 
alone chants the first half of the first verse). 


He that loveth wisdom loveth life: and they that 
seek her early shall be filled with joy. 

Teach me, O Lord, the way of Thy statutes: and 
I shall keep it unto the end. 

Give me understanding, and I shall keep Thy law: 
yea, I shall keep it with my whole heart. 

The path of the just is as the shining light: shin- 
ing more and more unto the perfect day. 


MUNDA COR MEUM. 


At High Celebration the Gospel is read by the Deacon 
(or a separate Gospeller may be appointed). He kneels 
before the centre of the Altar and intones the follow- 
img prayer: : 

Cleanse my heart and my lips, O God Who by 
the hand of Thy Seraph didst cleanse the lips of the 
prophet Isaiah with a burning coal from Thine Al- 
tar, and in Thy lovingkindness so purify me that I 
may worthily proclaim Thy holy Gospel. Through 
Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


+ HOLY EUCHARIST 179 


Lhe Celebrant blesses him in the following words: 

May the Lord be in thy + heart and on thy - 
lips, that through thy heart the love of God may shine 
forth, and through thy lips His power be made mani- 
fest. R. Amen. 

If the Celebrant be without assistants, he himself in- 
tones both the prayer and the blessing, substituting 
““my’? for ‘‘thy’? in the latter. 

THE GOSPEL 

Deacon. The Lord be with you. 

C. And with thy spirit. 

As soon as the Gospel is announced all sing the fol- 
lowing, making the sign of the cross with the right 
thumb upon the forehead, lips and breast successively: 

Glory be to Thee, O Lord. 

The Gospel ended, all sing: 

Praise be to Thee, O Christ. 


THE SERMON 

If there be a sermon, it follows here. 

CREDO* 

Then is recited the Symbol of the Faith, called Nicene 
—the Church’s ancient presentation of the Christian 
revelation.+ It is intoned by all, standing and facing 
to the east. All bow the head at the words ‘‘Jesus’’ 
and ‘‘is worshipped.?’ 





*Any of the forms given under the heading ‘‘Creeds 
and Acts of Faith,’’ p. 166, may be substituted for 
this if preferred. 

+ The Liberal Catholic Church leaves to its members 
perfect freedom in the interpretation of Scriptures, 
Creeds and Liturgy. 

““The ancient Church altered the language of the 
Creeds from time to time, in order to meet the ad- 
vanee of religious thought. The modern Church has 
retained the words but altered their interpretation.’’ 
—Canon M. G. Glazebrook in The Faith of a Modern 
Churchman. 


180 ‘i HOLY EUCHARIST ° 


———————————— 


We* believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker 


of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and 
invisible. 

And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the alone-bornt Son 
of God; begotten of His Father before all agest, God 
of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, be- 
gotten, not made, being of one Substance with the 
Father, by Whom all things were made. Who for us 
men and for our salvation came down from heaven 
(here all genuflect in reverence for the mystery of 
the Incarnation) and was incarnate, of** the Holy 
Ghost and the Virgin Mary, and was made man. 
(All rise again.) And was crucified also for us; under 
Pontius Pilate He suffered, and was buried. And the 
third day He rose again according to the Scriptures, 
and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right 
hand of the Father. And He shall come again with 
glory to judge both the quick and the dead: Whose 
Kingdom shall have no end. 

And we believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, the 
Giver of Life. Who proceedeth from the Father and 
the Son, Who with the Father and the Son together 
is worshipped and glorified, Who spake by the Pro- 
phets. And we believe one holy catholic and apos- 
tolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the 





*The original form, The distinction between ‘‘we’’ 
and ‘‘I’’ marks the difference between Conciliar and 
Baptismal Creeds, that is to say, between the con- 
fession of the common faith and the confession of the 
individual faith. 

+ Greek ‘monogenes,’ that is, born from -a single 
principle, not from a syzygy or pair. It is difficult to 
find a short and suitable equivalent for this in’ Eng- 
lish. ‘Only-begotten’ is altogether misleading.

of the Gnostic nomenclature, signifying ‘emanations.’

of the dead > and the life of the world to come. 
Amen. 
P. The Lord be with you. 
C. And with thy spirit. 
OFFERTORIUM 


A hymn is usually sung here, white the offertory is 
taken. At the end of the hymn the people are seated, 
and the following sentences are intoned by the Priest: 


From the rising up of the sun even unto the go- 
ing down of the same the Lord’s Name shall be mag- 
nified; and in every place incense shall be offered 
unto His Name, and a pure offering. There shall be 
heard in this place the voice of joy and the voice 
of gladness, the voice of them that shall bring the 
sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord. 

The Priest offers the host, saying: ; 

We adore Thee, O God, Who art the source of all 
life and goodness, and with true and thankful hearts 
we offer unto Thee this token of Thine own life- 
giving gifts bestowed upon us, Thou Who art the 
giver of all. / 

He pours wine and a little water into the chalice, 
saying: 

According to immemorial custom, O Lord, we now 
mix water with this wine, praying Thee that we may 
evermore abide in Christ. and He in us. 

He offers the chalice, saying: 

We offer unto Thee, O Lord, this chalice with joy 
and gladness; may the worship which we offer ascend 
before Thy Divine Majesty as a sacrifice, pure and 
acceptable in Thy sight. Through Christ our Lord. 
R. Amen. 

THE SECOND CENSING 

The Priest censes the oblations and the Altar in the 
prescribed manner, and says: 

As this: incense rises before Thee, O Lord, so 
Jet. our prayer be set forth in Thy sight. Let Thy 


182 HOLY EUCHARIST 


MOET Se 
holy Angels encompass Thy people and breathe forth 
upon them the spirit of Thy blessing. 

As he returns the censer to the thurifer or deacon, he 
Says: 

May the Lord enkindle within us the fire of His 
love and the flame of everlasting charity. 

The Priests, clerics, choir and people are censed- 
The people stand as the thurifer approaches them, bow 
before and after being censed, and are seated. During 
the censing of the choir and people the Priest recites 
the Lavabo in a low tone, raising his voice for the 
Gloria. 

LAVABO 

I will wash my hands in innocency, O Lord: and so 
will I go to Thine Altar. 3 

That I may show the voice of thanksgiving: and 
tell of all Thy wondrous works. 

Lord, I have loved the habitation of Thy house: 
and the ‘place where Thine honour dwelleth. 

My foot standeth right: I will praise the Lord in the 
congregations. 

Glory be to the Father and to the Son: and to the 
Holy Ghost. 

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be: world without end. BR. Amen. 

The people stand. 


ORATE FRATRES 

P. Brethren, pray that my sacrifice and yours 
may be acceptable to God the Father Almighty. 

C. May the Lord receive the sacrifice at thy 
hands, and sanctify our lives in His service. 

The people kneel. 

P. We lay before Thee, O Lord, these Thy crea- 
tures of bread and wine, in + token of our sacrifice 
of praise and thanksgiving; for here we offer and 
present unto Thee ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be 
a holy and continual sacrifice unto Thee, that we, 
who are very members incorporate in the mystical 
body of Thy Son, which is the blessed company of all 


HOLY EUCHARIST 183 


faithful people, may hear that His most joyful voice: 
““Come unto Me, O ye that be blessed of My Father, 
and possess the kingdom which is prepared for you 
from the beginning. of the world,’’ through the same 
Jesus Christ, our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with 
Thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, ever one God 
throughout all ages of ages. R. Amen. 


THE CANON 


The people rise, and the following passages are sung 
alternately : 

P. The Lord be with you. 

C. And with thy spirit. 


SURSUM CORDA 


Lift up your hearts. 

We lift them up unto the Lord. 

Let us give thanks unto our Lord God. 
It is meet and right so to do. 


PREFACE 


P. It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, 
that we should at all times and in all places give 
thanks unto Thee, O Lord, holy Father, Almighty 
everlasting God. (Here follows the proper Preface, 
if any). Therefore with Angels and Archangels, with 
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers, 
with Cherubim, and Seraphim, and with all the com- 
pany of heaven, we laud and magnify Thy glorious 
Name, evermore praising Thee and saying: 


SANCTUS AND BENEDICTUS QUI VENIT 
The people kneel and sing the following. The 
bell is rung each time the word ‘‘ Holy’’ is uttered. 


Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts, Heaven and 
earth are full of Thy glory; glory be to Thee, O Lord 
most high. © 


Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the 
Lord. > Hosanna in the highest.

THE PRAYER OF CONSECRATION* 


P, Wherefore, O most loving Father, we Thy ser-— 
vants do pray Thee, through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, 
our -Lord, to + receive, to + purify, and to 
+ hallow this oblation which we make unto Thee. 
We desire to offer this holy Sacrifice first for Thy 
holy catholic Church; that it may please Thee to grant 
her peace, to watch over her, to bring her to unity, 
and to guide her throughout the world; likewise for 
Thy servants George our King,t N. our Presiding 
Bishop, N. our Bishop, for all our Bishops, clergy and 
faithful, and for all here present, whose faith and 
devotion are known unto Thee. We do also call to 
mind all who in this transitory life are in trouble, 
sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity (es- 
pecially ...). Likewise do we offer it for all those 
Thy children whom it hath pleased Thee to deliver 
from the burden of the flesh (especially for .. .), that, 
freed from earthly toil and care, they may enjoy 
the felicity of Thy Presence, evermore praising Thee 
im word and deed, O God everlasting, living, and 
true. 

{[Uniting in this joyful Sacrifice with Thy holy 
Church throughout all the ages, we lift our hearts 
in adoration to Thee, O God the Son, consubstantial, 
co-eternal with the Father, Who, abiding unchange- 
able within Thyself, didst nevertheless in the mystery 
of Thy boundless love and Thine eternal Sacrifice 
preathe forth Thine own divine life into Thy universe, 
and thus didst offer Thyself as the Lamb slain from 
the foundation of the world, dying in» very truth 
that we might live. : 





*Throughout the Prayer of Consecration where 
erosses are to be made by the Priest, they are made 
over the sacred elements collectively, save where, on 
the one hand, Body or Bread is mentioned, and, on the 
other, Blood or Chalice. 

tThis, of course, will be varied outside the British 
Empire. 

{The portion in brackets may be omitted. 


HOLY EUCHARIST 185 


Omnipotent, all-pervading, by that self-same Sac- 
rifice Thou dost continually uphold all creation, rest- 
ing not by night nor day, working evermore through 
that most august Hierarchy of Thy glorious Saints, 
Who live but to do Thy will as perfect channels of 
Thy wondrous power, to Whom we ever offer heart- 
felt love and reverence. 


Thou, O most dear and holy Lord, hast in Thine 
ineffable wisdom deigned to ordain for us this Blessed 
Sacrament of Thy love, that in it we may not only 
commemorate in symbol that Thine eternal Oblation, 
but verily take part in it, and perpetuate thereby, 
within the limitations of time and space which veil 
our earthly eyes from the excess of Thy glory, the 
enduring Sacrifice by which the world is nourished 
and sustained. ] 


With his hands spread over the offerings, he continues: 


Wherefore, O holy Lord, Father Almighty, we pray 
Thee to look down on and accept these offerings, 
which we Thy servants and Thy whole household 
do make unto Thee, in obedience to the command of 
Thy most blessed Son, our Lord Jesus Christ; 


Which offerings do Thou, O Father, deign with 
Thy Holy Spirit and Word to + bless, + approve, 
and + ratify, that they may become for us His most 
precious + Body and + Blood. 


Who the day before He suffered took bread into His 
holy and venerable hands, and with His eyes lifted 
up to heaven unto Thee, God, His Almighty Father, 
giving thanks to Thee, He + blessed, brake, and 
gave it to His disciples, saying: Take and eat ye 
all of this, for 


THIS IS MY BODY. 


In like manner, after He had supped; taking also 
this noble chalice into His holy and venerable hands, 
again giving thanks to Thee, He + -blessed it and 
gave it to His disciples, saying: Take and drink ye 
all of this, for 





186 HOLY EUCHARIST 


THIS IS MY BLOOD. 


As oft as ye shall do these things, ye shall do them 
in remembrance of Me, 

After some moments of silent adoration, the follow- 
ing verse shall be sung very softly, all devoutly kneel- 
ing: 

Thee we adore, O hidden Splendour, Thee, 
Who in Thy Sacrament dost deign to be; 
We worship Thee beneath this earthly veil, 
And here Thy Presence we devoutly hail. 


After a short pause all stand and sing the Adeste 
Fideles, as under: : 


O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, 

O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem. 

Come and behold Him, Monarch of the Angels; 

O come, let us adore Him; O come, let us adore Him; 
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord. 


God of God, Light of Light, 

Yet under earthly forms His Light He veils, 
Very God, alone-born of the Father; 

O come, let us adore Him, ete. 


Sing, choirs of Angels, sing in exultation; 
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above; 
Glory to God in the highest; 

O come, let us adore Him, ete. 


Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, throned on Thine Altar; 
Ever to Thee be highest glory given, 

Word of the Father, Splendour everlasting; 

O come, let us adore Him, ete. Amen. 

The people again kneel. 

P. Wherefore, O Lord and heavenly Father, we 
Thy humble servants, bearing in mind the ineffable 
sacrifice of Thy Son, the mystery of His wondrous 
incarnation, His mighty resurrection, and His trium- 
phant ascension, do here make before Thy Divine 
Majesty the memorial which our Lord hath willed us 
to make, and we do offer unto Thee this, the most 
_ precious gift which Thou hast bestowed upon us: 


HOLY EUCHARIST 187 





this pure + Host, this holy + Host, this glorious 
+ Host, the holy -++ Bread of life everlasting, and 
the -+ Chalice of eternal salvation. 


This do we present before Thee in token of our 
love and of the perfect devotion and sacrifice of our 
minds and hearts to Thee; and we pray that Thou 
wouldst command Thy holy Angel to bear our obla- 
tion to Thine Altar on high, there to be offered by 
Him Who, as the eternal High Priest, for ever offers 
Himself as the eternal Sacrifice. 


And as He hath ordained that the heavenly Sac- 
rifice shall be mirrored here on earth through the 
ministry of mortal men, to the end that Thy holy 
people may be knit more closely into fellowship with 
Thee, we do pray for Thy servant who ministers at 
this Altar, that, meetly celebrating the mysteries of 
the most holy + Body and + Blood of Thy Son, he 
may be + filled with Thy mighty power and bless- 


He makes this last cross upon himself. 


ing. Likewise we pray Thee to sanctify Thy people here 
present with these Thy heavenly gifts, and through 
these mysteries do Thou + hallow, + quicken, and 
+ bless them, that both in their hearts and in their 
lives they may show forth Thy praise and glorify 
Thy holy Name. 


He makes with the Host the sign of the cross three 
_ times over the Chalice. J 


All these things do we ask, O Father, in the Name 
and through the mediation of Thy most blessed Son, 
for we acknowledge and confess with our hearts and 
lips that + by Him were all things made, yea, all 
things both in heaven and earth; + with Him as the 
indwelling Life do all things exist, and + in Him as 
the transcendent Glory all things live and move and 
have their being: 


Then horizontally twice between the Chalice and his 
breast. 


To Whom with thee, O mighty + Father, in the 


188 HOLY BUCHARIST 


unity of the Holy + Spirit, be ascribed all honour 


and glory, throughout the ages of ages. R. Amen. 


The Priest here holds the Host directly over the 
Chalice, and raises both to the level of his eyes. 


THE COMMUNION 
*[P. Let us pray. 


Instructed by the words of sacred Scripture, and 
following the tradition of holy Church from of old, 
we now say: 


All now sing or intone: 


Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy 
Name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on 
earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily 
bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive 
them that trespass against us. And lead us not 
into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine 
is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever 
and ever. Amen.] 


THE COMMEMORATION OF THE SAINTS 


P. Here do we give unto Thee, O Lord, most 
high praise and hearty thanks for the wonderful 
grace and virtue declared in holy Mary, the ever- 
virgin Mother, and in all Thy glorious Saints from 
the beginning of the world, who have been the choice 
vessels of Thy grace and a shining light unto many 
generations. 


Here the Priest crosses himself with the paten. 


And we +. join with them in worship before Thy 
great white throne, whence fiow all love and light 
and blessing through all the worlds which Thou hast

+ strength, Thy + peace and Thy + blessing, which 
Thou dost give us in this. holy Sacrament, may be

Christ, wast made known to Thy disciples in the

THE SALUTATION OF PEACE 


O Lord Jesu Christ, Who didst say to Thine apos- 
tles: ‘‘Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto 
you,’’ regard not our weakness, but the faith of 
Thy Church, and grant her that peace and unity 
which are agreeable to Thy holy will and command- 
ment. R. Amen. 


The Salutation of Peace, which follows, is first given 
by the Priest to one of the clergy. It is then passed 
from one to another in the sanctuary. The last recipi- 
ent turns towards the people, and, with outstretched 
arms, sings the words to them. (At Low Celebration 
the Priest himself faces the people, and, with uplifted 
arms, utters the words of salutation.) 


P. The peace of the Lord be always with you. 
C. And with thy spirit. 


P.. O Thou Who in this adorable Sacrament hast 
left us a living memorial and pledge of Thy marvel- 
lous love for mankind, and dost therein graciously 
draw us into wondrous and mystic communion with 
Thee, grant us so to receive the sacred mysteries of 
Thy Body and Blood that our souls may be lifted 
into the immensity of Thy love, and that, being filled 
with a high endeavour, we may ever be mindful of 
Thine indwelling Presence and breathe forth the frag- 
rance of a holy life. R. Amen.

me 


The Priest, clergy and servers recewe Holy Com-— 
munition. 


The people meanwhile may say privately the follow- 
ing prayer: 


Unto Thee, O Perfect One, the Lord and Lover 
of men, do we commend our life and hope. For Thou 
art the Heavenly Bread, the Life of the whole world; 
Thou art in all places and endurest all things, the 
Treasury of endless good and the Well of infinite com- 
passion. 


After the Priest and those in the sanctuary have re- 
ceived Holy Communion, the Priest, with a Particle, 
blesses the people, as he says: 


+ Ye that desire to partake of the Body of the 
Lord, draw nigh and receive this most holy Sacra- 
ment. 


The people should come forward to the Communion 
rail and kneel.* 


As he administers the Holy Communion to each, the 
Priest says: 


The Body of our Lord Christ keep thee unto life 
eternal. 


The Communion being ended, the Priest says: 


Under the veil of earthly things now have we 
communion with our Lord Jesus Christ; soon with 
open face shall we behold Him, and, rejoicing in His 
glory, be made like unto Him. Then shall His true 
disciples be brought by Him with exceeding joy 
before the presence of His Father’s glory. 





*It is the custom in our churches to administer 
the Sacred Host directly into the mouth, and not into 
the hand of the communicant, for which purpose the 
head should be held upright, the mouth opened, and 
the tongue slightly extended beyond the lips during 
the administration.

ing, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge 
and love of God, and of His Son, Christ our Lord; and 
the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, 4 the Son 
and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you, and remain

to become, show you the Light you seek, give you the 
strong aid of Their compassion and Their wisdom.

in the hearts of those who live in the Eternal; there 
is a power that maketh all things new; it lives and 
moves in those who know the Self as One. May that 
peace brood over you, that power uplift you, till you 
stand where the One Initiator is invoked, till you 
see His }4 Star shine forth, R. Amen.
