Adnuent Sunday 


The Collect 


O CHRIST our Lord, we pray for strength to cast 
away the works of darkness and put upon us the ar- 
mour of light, that we may prepare ourselves not 
only to keep aright Thy holy Feast of Christmas, but 
also faithfully and acceptably to serve Thee when 
Thou shalt come again, to Whom we ever offer heart- 
felt love and worship. R. Amen, 


This Collect 1s to be repeated every day, after the 
Collect appointed for the day, until Christmas Eve. 
The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the thirteenth chapter of 
that of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans, beginning 
at the first verse. 


LET every soul be subject unto the higher powers; 


a 


ADVENT SUNDAY 27 





for there is no power but of God, and the powers that 
be are ordained of God. Render therefore to all their 
dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom 
custom; honour to whom honour. Owe no man 
anything, but to love one another; for he that loveth 
another hath fulfilled the law. Love worketh no ill 
to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilling of 
the law. And that, knowing the time, that now it 
is high time to awake out of sleep; for now is our 
salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is 
far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the 
works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of 
light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in 
rioting and drunkenness, not in strife and envying; 
for none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth 
to himself. Let not then your good be evil spoken 
of, but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ; for the king- 
dom of God is righteousness, and peace and joy in 
the Holy Ghost. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-first chap- 
ter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the 
twenty-seventh verse. 


THEN shall they see the Son of Man coming in 
a cloud with power and great glory. When these 
things begin to:come to pass, then look up and lift 
up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh. 
And take heed to yourselves, lest at. any time your 
hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and with the 
cares of this life, and so that day come upon you un- 
awares. Watch ye therefore, that ye may be ac- 
counted worthy to escape all these things that shall 
come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man. 
In your patience possess ye your souls; heaven and 
earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass 


away. 


28 SECOND SUNDAY IN ADVENT 


ae Second Sunday in Adnent. 
The Collect 


O GOD, Creator and Preserver of mankind, we 
thank Thee for Thy never-failing love, and do most 
earnestly desire and resolve to show forth Thy praise 
not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving 
up ourselves to Thy service, and by walking before 
Thee in holiness and righteousness all our days, 
through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the fifth chapter of the 
First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Thessalon- 
jans, beginning at the eleventh verse. 


WHEREFORE comfort yourselves together and 
edify one another, and be at peace among yourselves. 
We exhort you, brethren, warn them which are un- 
ruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, 
be patient toward all men. See that none render 
evil for evil unto any man, but ever follow that 
which is good, both among yourselves and to all 


men. Rejoice evermore, and in everything give 
thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus 
concerning you. Quench not the Spirit; prove all 


things; hold fast that which is good and abstain 
from all appearance of evil. And the very God of 
peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole 
spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto 
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the fourth chapter 
of that according to St. Mark, beginning at the twenty- 
fourth verse. 


THIRD SUNDAY IN ADVENT 29 





TAKE heed what ye hear; with what measure ye 
mete, it shall be measured to you; and unto you that 
hear shall more be given. For he that hath, to him 
shall be given; and he that hath not, from him shall 
be taken even that which he hath. So is the king- 
dom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the 
ground and should sleep and rise night and day 
and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth 
not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of her- 
self: first the blade, then the ear, and after that 
the full corn in the ear. But when the fruit is brought 
forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because 
the harvest is come. Whereunto shall we liken the 
kingdom of God? Or with what comparison shall 
we compare it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, 
which when it is sown in the earth is less than 
all the seeds that be in the earth; but when it is 
sown it groweth up, and becometh greater than all 
herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the 
fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. 





Che Third Sunday in Adnent 
The Collect 


GRANT us, O Lord, so to prepare and make ready 
Thy way, by turning the hearts of the disobedient 
to the wisdom of the just, that when Thou shalt 
come to teach the world, the ground may be found 
fit for Thy sowing, Thou Who art the Teacher alike 
of Angels and of men. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the first chapter of the Book of the 
Prophet Malachi, beginning at the eleventh verse. 


FROM the rising of the sun even unto the going 
down of the same My Name shall be great among 


30 THIRD SUNDAY IN ADVENT 


the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be 
offered unto My Name and a pure offering. Be- 
hold, I will send My messenger, and he shall prepare 
the way before Me; and the Lord Whom ye seek 
shall suddenly come to His temple, even the messen- 
ger of the covenant whom ye delight in; behold, He 
shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts. But who may 
abide the day of His coming; and who shall stand 
when He appeareth? For He is like a refiner’s 
fire, and like fullers’ soap. And He shall sit as a 
refiner and purifier of silver; and He shall purify 
the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and sil- 
ver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering 
in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah 
and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord; and they 
shall be Mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day 
when I make up My jewels. 
Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the first chapter of 
that according to St. Mark, beginning at the first verse. 


THE beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the 
Son of God; as it is written in the prophets: Behold, 
I send my messenger before Thy face, which shall 
prepare Thy way before Thee; the voice of one cry- 
ing in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the 
Lord, make His paths straight. John did baptize 
in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repent- 
ance for the remission of sins. And there went out 
unto him all the land of Judzea, and they of Jeru- 
salem, and were all baptized of him in the river 
Jordan, confessing their sins. And John was clothed 
with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his 
loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; and 
preached, saying: There cometh after me One might- 
ier than I, the latchet of Whose shoes I am not 
worthy to stoop down and unloose. I indeed have 
baptized you with water, but He shall baptize you 
with the Holy Ghost. 


FOURTH SUNDAY IN ADVENT 31 


Che Faurth Sunday in Adnent 
The Collect 


ALMIGHTY everliving God, we pray Thee to in- 
Spire continually Thy universal Church with the 
spirit of truth, unity and concord, that all they who 
do confess Thy holy Name may agree in the truth of 
Thy holy Word, and live in unity and godly love, 
through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the twelfth chapter of the 
First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians, 
beginning at the twelfth verse. 


AS the body is one and hath many members, and 
all the members of that body, being many, are one 
body; so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all 
baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gen- 
tiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all 
made to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not 
one member, but many; and the eye cannot say 
unto the hand: I have no need of thee; nor again the 
head to the feet: I have no need of you. There 
should be no schism in the body, but the members 
should have the same care one for another. And 
where one member suffers, all the members suffer 
with it; or one member be honoured, all the members 
rejoice with it. Now ye are the body of Christ, and 
members in particular. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the thirteenth chapter 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the third 
verse. 

JESUS, knowing that the Father had given all 
things into His hands, and that He was come from 





32 CHRISTMAS DAY 


God, and went to God, riseth from supper, and laid 
aside His garments; and took a towel, and girded Him- 
self. After that He poured water into a basin, and 
began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them 
with the towel wherewith He was girded. So after 
He had washed their feet, and had taken His gar- 
ments, and was set down again, He said unto them: 
Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call Me Mas- 
ter and Lord; and ye say well, for so I am. If I 
then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye © 
also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have 
given you an example, that ye should do as I have 
done to you. Amen, Amen, I say unto you: The 
servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that 
is sent greater than he that sent him. If 
ye know these things, happy are ye if ye 
do them. Amen, Amen, I say unto you: He that 
receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth Me; and he 
that receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me. A 
new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one 
another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one 
another. By this shall all men know that ye are 
My disciples, if ye have love one to another. 





Che Nativity of our Lord,

The Collect 


MOST dear and holy Lord, we praise Thee, we bless 
Thee, with all our hearts do we thank and glorify Thee 
for this Thy wondrous Feast of Christmas, praying 
Thee that as Thou wast born on earth as at this time 
for us, so mayest Thou be born and reign for ever- 
more within the hearts of men, Who with the Father 
and the Holy Spirit art one God throughout all ages 
of ages. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 
The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 











CHRISTMAS DAY 33 





is taken from the seventh chapter of the Book of the 
Prophet Isaiah, beginning at the fourteenth verse, 


THE Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a 
Virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call 
His Name Emmanuel. And it shall be said: The people 
that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they 
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon 
them hath the light shined. They joy before Thee 
according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice 
when they divide the spoil. For unto us a Child is 
born, unto us a Son is given; and the government 
shall be upon His shoulder; and His Name shall be 
called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The 
Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the in- 
crease of His government and peace there shall be no 
end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, 
to order it and to establish it with judgment and with 
justice from henceforth even for ever. 


Here endeth the Epistle 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the second chapter of 
that according to St. Luke, beginning at the first verse. 


IT came to pass in those days that there went out a 
decree from Cesar Augustus that all the world should 
be enrolled. And all went to be enrolled, everyone 
into his own city. And Joseph also went up from 
Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, into 
the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because 
he was of the house and lineage of David) to be 
snrolled with Mary his espoused wife, being great with 
shild. And so it was that, while they were there, 
she days were accomplished that she should be deliv- 
sred. And she brought forth her first-born son, and 
wrapped Him in swaddling clothes, and laid Him ina 
manger because there was no room for them in the 
nn. And there were in the same country shepherds 
wbiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock 

(e

by night. And, lo, the Angel of the Lord came upon 
them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about 
them, and they were sore afraid. And the Angel said 


unto them: Fear not, for behold, I bring you good 
tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For 


unto you is born this day in the city of David a 


Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a — 


sign unto you; ye shall find the babe wrapped in 
swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly 


there was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly 
host praising God, and saying: Glory to God in the | 


highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men. 


The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for 


every day after until Complin on New Year’s Eve, unless 
otherwise ordered. 





New Yrar’s Bay 
The Collect 


LORD Christ, the new-born Child, Who yet art the 
Ancient of Days, we dedicate this new-born year to 


Thee, praying that in it Thy holy Church may love. 
Thee more and serve Thee better, growing ever in 
Thy heavenly wisdom as the years roll by, Who 


throughout eternity dost live and reign, one God with 
the Father and the Holy Spirit. R. Amen. 


Then shall be said (on New Year’s Day only) the Col- 


lect for Christmas. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the sixth chapter of that of 
St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans, beginning at the 
third verse. , 


KNOW ye not that so many of us as were baptized 
into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death? There- 
fore we are buried with Him by baptism into death; 
that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the 


Paces * 





NEW YEAR’S DAY 35 





glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in 
newness of life. For if we have been planted together 
in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the 
likeness of His resurrection; knowing this, that our 
old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin 
might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not 
serve sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe 
that we shall also live with Him; knowing that Christ 
being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath 
‘no more dominion over Him. -For in that He died, He 
died unto sin once; but in that He liveth, He liveth 
unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be 
dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through 
Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in 
your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts 
thereof. Neither yield ye your members as _ in- 
struments of unrighteousness unto sin; but yield your- 
selves unto God, as those that are alive from the 
dead, and your members as instruments of righteous- 
mess unto God. For the wages of sin is death; but 
the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ 
our Lord. 





Here endeth the Epistle 


The Gospel 


| The holy Gospel is taken from the fifth chapter of that 
according to St. Matthew, beginning at the fourteenth 
verse. 


YE are the light of the world. Let your light so 
shine before men, that they may see your good works 
and glorify your Father Which is in heaven. But 
take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to 
ibe seen of them; otherwise ye have no reward of your 
i\Father Which is in heaven. Therefore when thou 
hloest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, 
as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the 
streets, that they may have glory of men. Amen, I 
ay unto you, they have their reward. But when thou 
oest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right 
and doeth, that thine alms may be in secret; and thy 
| C2 



















36 THE EPIPHANY 


Father Which seeth in secret Himself shall reward — 
thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon 
earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where 
thieves break through and steal; but lay up for 
yourselves treasures in’ heaven, where neither moth 
nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break 
through nor steal; for where your treasure is, there ~ 
will your heart be also. The light of the body is the 
eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body 
shall be full of light. Be ye therefore perfect, even 
as your Father Which is in heaven is perfect. 


The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for 
every day after, unto the Epiphany.

The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the twenty-first chapter of the Revelation 
of St. John the Divine, beginning at the third verse. 


BEHOLD, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He 
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, 
and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God, 
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; 
and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor 
crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the 
former things are passed away. Behold, I make all 
things new. I will give unto him that is athirst of 
the fountain of the water of life freely. He that 
overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be his

God and he shall be My son. Behold, I come quickly, 
and My reward is with Me, to give every man ac- 

> cording as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega, 
the beginning and the end, the first and the last. 
I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright 
and morning star. And the Spirit and the bride say, 
Come; and let him that heareth say, Come. And let 
him that is athirst come, and whosoever will, let him 
take the water of life freely. Surely I come quickly. 
Amen; even so, come, Lord Jesus. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the second chapter of 
that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the first 
verse. 


WHEN Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judza, in 
the days of Herod the King, behold, there came Wise 
Men from the East to Jerusalem, saying: Where is 
He that is born King of the Jews ? For we have 
seen His star in the Hast, and are come to worship 
Him. When Herod the King heard these things, he 
was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and when 
he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of 
the people together, he demanded of them where 
Christ should be born. And they said unto him: In 
Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written by the pro- 
phet: And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, 
art not the least among the princes of Juda; for out 
of thee shall come a governor, that shall rule My 
people Israel. Then Herod, when he had privily 
‘called the Wise Men, inquired of them diligently what 
time the star appeared. And he sent them to Beth- 
lehem, and said: Go and search diligently for the 
young Child; and when ye have found Him, bring 
“me word again, that I may come and worship Him 
| also. When they had heard the King, they departed; 
and lo, the star which they had seen in the East went 
‘before them, till it came and stood over where the 


38 SECOND SUNDAY AFTER THE EPIPHANY 


young Child was. And when they saw the star they 
rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they 
were come into the house they saw the young Child 
with Mary His mother, and fell down, and worshipped 
Him; and when they ~had opened their treasures, 
they presented unto Him gifts, gold and frankincense 
and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream 
that they should not return to Herod, they departed 
into their own country another way. 


The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve until 
the Baptism of Our Lord, or until the Second Sunday 
after the Epiphany, tf that should fall earlier than the 
Baptism.

Intent: Fellowship 


The Collect 


O LORD Christ, we thank Thee that it hath pleased 
Thee to draw us into wondrous fellowship with Thee 
through Thy mystical body the Church, and we pray 
that all who profess and call themselves Christians 
may grow into the fullness of Thy love, and hold the 
faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in 
righteousness of life, O Thou great King of Love, 
to Whom be praise and adoration from men and 
from the Angel host. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the first chapter of that of 
St. Paul the Apostle to the Colossians, beginning at 
the ninth verse.

that ye might be filled with the knowledge of His will

in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that ye 
“might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, 
.being fruitful in every good work, and increasing 
in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, 
according to His glorious power, unto all patience 
and long-suffering with joyfulness; giving thanks 
unto the Father, Which hath made us meet to be 
-partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, 
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, 
and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear 
Son, Who is the image of the invisible God, the first- 
born of every creature. For by Him were all things 
created, that are in heaven and that are in earth, 
visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or do- 
minions or principalities or powers: all things were 
created by Him, and for Him; and He is before all 
things, and by Him all things consist. And He is 
the head of the body, the Church, Who is the begin- 
ning, the first-born from the dead; that in all things 
He might have the pre-eminence, 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the seventh chapter 
of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the 
second verse. 


NOW a certain centurion’s servant, who was very 
dear unto him, was sick and ready to die. And when 
‘he heard of Jesus, he sent unto Him the elders of the 
Jews, beseeching Him that He would come and heal 
his servent. And when they came to Jesus, they be- 
sought Him instantly, saying that he was worthy 
‘for whom He should do this: for he loveth our na- 
tion, and he hath built us a synagogue. Then Jesus 
went with them. And when He was now not far 
from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, 
saying unto Him: Lord, trouble not Thyself; for I 
am not worthy that Thou shouldest enter under my 
roof (wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to

come unto Thee); but say in a word, and my servant 
shall be healed. For I also am a man set under 
authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto 
one: Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and 
he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth 
it. When Jesus heard these things, He marvelled at 
him, and turned Him about, and said unto the people 
that followed Him: I say unto you, I have not found 
so great faith; no, not in Israel. And they that were 
sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole 
that had been sick.

The Collect 


O LORD, Who didst unsparingly rebuke injustice 
and hypocrisy, we pray that we may be just and 
true of heart in all our dealings with ourselves and 
with our brethren, that we may live openly and 
without guile before Thee, O Thou great King of 
Righteousness, to Whom be praise for ever and ever. | 
R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the nineteenth chapter of the Book 
of Ecclesiasticus, beginning at the sixth verse. 


HE that can rule his tongue shall live without 
strife; and he that hateth babbling shall have less 
evil. Rehearse not unto another that which is told 
unto thee, and thou shalt fare never the worse. Whe- 
ther it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men’s 
lives; and if thou canst without offence, reveal them 
not. If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee. 


THIRD SUNDAY AFTER THE EPIPHANY 41 





Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it; 
and if he have done it, that he do it no more. Ad- 
monish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it; 
and if he have, that he speak it not again. Admonish 
a friend, for many times it is a slander; and believe 
not every tale. There is one that slippeth in his 
speech, but not from his heart; and who is he that 
hath not offended with his tongue? The knowledge 
of the commandments of the Lord is the doctrine of 
life; and they that do things that please Him shall 
receive the fruit of the tree of immortality; for to 
know Him is perfect righteousness, yea, to know His 
power is the root of immortality. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-third 
chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning 
at the twenty-third verse. 


WOE unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! 
for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have 
omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, 
“mercy and faith; these ought ye to have done, and 
not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides, 
| which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel, ye make 
clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but 
within they are full of extortion and excess. Cleanse 
first that which is within the cup and platter, that 
‘the outside of them may be clean also, Ye are like 
‘unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beauti- 
ful outwardly, but within are full of dead men’s 
bones and of all uncleanness. Hven so ye outwardly 
appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of 
hypocrisy and iniquity. And He said unto His dis- 
ciples: Do not ye after their works; for they say 
and do not. All their works they do for to be seen 
of men; but whosoever shall exalt himself shall be 
abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

ALMIGHTY Father, we pray that we may bear 
within ourselves a calm and steadfast mind, that 
we may meet the blows of life with courage and with 
cheerfulness, and ever lift glad hearts to Thee, Who

R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the first chapter of the 
First Epistle General of St. Peter, beginning at the 
second verse. 


Grace unto you and peace be multiplied. Blessed 
be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who 
according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us 
again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus 
Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible 
and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in 
heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God 
through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed 
in the last time. Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though 
now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness 
through manifold temptations; that the trial of your 
faith, being much more precious than of gold that 
perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be 
found unto praise and honour and glory at the ap- 
pearing of Jesus Christ, Whom, having not seen, ye 
love; in Whom, though now ye see Him not, yet be- 
lieving, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of 
glory. For ye are a chosen generation, a royal priest-

The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the sixteenth chapter 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the 
twentieth verse. 





AND Jesus said: Ye shall be sorrowful, but your 
sorrow shall be turned into joy. A little while, and 
ye shall not see Me; and again a little while, and ye 
shall see Me. Ye now therefore have sorrow; but I 
will see you again, and your hearts shall rejoice, and 
your joy no man taketh from you. Hitherto have ye 
asked nothing in My name; ask and ye shall receive, 
that your joy may be full. This is My command- 
ment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you. 
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay 
down his life for his friends. Ye are My friends, 
if ye do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I 
call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not 
what his lord doeth; but I have called you friends, 
for all things that I have heard of My Father I 
have made known unto you. These things I have 
spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, 
and that your joy might be full.

Intent: Steadfastness and Diligence 


The Collect 


LORD God, Whose never-ceasing watchfulness 
sweeteneth all the worlds, we crave for steadfastness, 
that we may eschew sloth, the sin which doth so easily 
beset us, and may constantly show diligence in Thy 
most holy service, through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


44 FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER THE EPIPHANY 
The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the sixth chapter of that 
of St. Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews, beginning at 
the tenth verse. 





GOD is not unrighteous to forget your work and 
labour of love, which ye have showed toward His 
Name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and 
do minister. And we desire that every one of you 
do show the same diligence to the full assurance of 
hope unto the end, that ye be not slothful, but fol- 
lowers of them who through faith and patience in- 
herit the promises. Wherefore, seeing we are com- 
passed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let 
us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so 
easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race 
which is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author 
and finisher of our faith. By Him, therefore, let us 
offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, the 
fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name. But to 
do good and to communicate forget not; for with such 
sacrifices God is well pleased. Wherefore lift up the 
hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, and 
make straight the paths for your feet, lest that 
which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it 
be rather healed. Follow peace with all men, and 
holiness (without which no man shall see the Lord), 
looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of 
God. Now the God of peace make you perfect in 
every good work to do His will, working in you 
that which is well pleasing in His sight, through 
Jesus Christ, to Whom be glory for ever and ever. 
Amen.

FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER THE EPIPHANY 45 





_ THE kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling 

into a far country, who called his servants, and de- 

livered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave 
“five talents, to another two, and to another one; to 
every man according to his several ability; and 
straightway took his journey. Then he that had re- 
ceived the five talents went and traded with the 
same, and made them other five talents. And like- 
wise he that had received two, he also gained other 
two. But he that had received one went and digged 
in the earth, and hid his lord’s money. After a long 
time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth 
with them. And so he that had received five talents 
came and brought other five talents, saying: Lord, 
thou deliveredst unto me five talents; behold, I have 
gained beside them five talents more. His lord said 
unto him: Well done, thou good and faithful ser- 
vant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I 
will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou 
into the joy of thy.lord. He also that had received | 
two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst 
unto me two talents; behold, J have gained 
two other talents beside them. His lord said unto 
him: Well done, good and faithful servant; thou 
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make 
thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy 
of thy lord. Then he which had received one talent 
came and said: Lord, I knew thee that thou art an 
hard man, and I was afraid, and went and hid thy 
talent in the earth; lo, there thou hast that is thine. 
But his lord answered and said unto him: Thou 
wicked and slothful servant, thou oughtest to have 
put my money to the exchangers, and then at my 
coming I should have received mine own with usury. 
Take therefore the talent from him and give it unto 
him which hath ten talents. For unto every one that 
hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance; 
but from him that hath not shall be taken away even 
* that which he hath.

Intent: Discrimination 


The Collect 


O GOD, forasmuch as in the changes and chances 
of this mortal life it must needs be that we meet 
with many and great temptations, grant that we may 
be wary to discern and strong to resist them, through 
Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the first chapter of the 
General Epistle of St. James, beginning at the second 
verse. 


MY brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into 
divers temptations; know this, that the trying of your 
faith worketh patience. But let patience have her 
perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, 
wanting nothing. Blessed is the man that endureth 
temptation; for when he is tried, he shall receive the 
crown of life which the Lord hath promised to them 
that love Him. Let no man say when he is tempted: 
I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted by 
evil, neither tempteth He any man; but every man 
is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, 
and enticed. Do not err, my beloved brethren; every 

good gift.and every perfect gift is from above, and 
cometh down from the Father of Lights, with Whom 
is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.

The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-fourth 


chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning

SEPTUAGESIMA — 47 


AS the days of Noah were, so shall the coming of 
the Son of Man be; for as in the days before the 
. flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giv- 
ing in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into 
the ark, and knew not until the flood came and took 
them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son 
of Man be. But of that day and that hour knoweth 
no man; no, not the Angels of heaven, but My Father 
only. Take ye heed, watch and pray, lest ye enter 
into temptation, for ye know not when the time is. 
The Son of Man is as a man taking ‘a fax journey, 
who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, 
and to every man his work, and commanded the por- 
ter to watch. Watch ye therefore, lest coming sud- 
denly He find you sleeping. What I say unto you, 
I say unto. all: Watch.

Intent: The Gift of Wisdom 


The Collect 


O GOD the Holy Ghost, pour out upon us, we pray 
_Thee, Thy wondrous gifts of wisdom and under- 
standing, that we through them may learn to love 
Thee more and serve Thee better, Who livest and 
reignest with the Father and the Son, One God for 
evermore. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Bpistle 
is taken from the seventh chapter of the Book of 
the Wisdom of Solomon, beginning at the twenty- 
second verse. 


_ ‘WISDOM, which is the worker of all things, taught 
me; for in her is an understanding spirit, holy, one

only, manifold, subtle, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, 
not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good, 
quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good, 
kind to man, steadfast, sure, free from care, having 
all power, overseeing all things, and going through 
all spirits, understanding, pure and most subtle. For 
Wisdom is more moving than any motion; she passeth 
and goeth through all things by reason of her pure- 
ness. For she is the breath of the power of God, and 
a pure infiuence fiowing from the glory of the Al- 
mighty; therefore can no defiled thing flow into her. 
For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, 
the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the 
image of His goodness. And, being but one, she can 
do all things; remaining in herself, she maketh all 
things new; and in all ages entering into holy souls, 
she maketh them friends of God, and prophets. For 
God loveth him that dwelleth with Wisdom. 
For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all 
the order of the stars. Being compared with the 
light, she is found before it. He that loveth her 
loveth life, and they that seek her early shall be 
filled with joy. He that holdeth her fast shall in- 
herit glory; and wheresoever she entereth, the Lord 
will bless. They that serve her shall minister to the 
Holy One; and them that love her the Lord doth 
love.

chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning 
at the first verse. . 


THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be likened 
unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went 
forth to meet the bridegroom, And five of them were 
wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish 
took their lamps, and took no oil with them; but 
the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and

slept, And at mignight there was a cry made: Be- 
hold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. 
‘Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 
And the foolish said unto the wise: Give us of your 
oil, for our lamps are gone out. But the wise answer- 
ed, saying: Not so; lest there be not enough for us 
and you; but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy 
for yourselves. And while they went to buy, the 
bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in 
with him to the marriage; and the door was shut. 
Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying: Lord, 
Lord, open to us. But he answered and said: Amen, 
I say unto you, I know you not. Watch therefore, 
for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein 
the Son of Man cometh.

Intent: The HOLY SPIRIT as Sanctifier 


The Collect 


O GOD the Holy Ghost, we pray Thee to direct, 
sanctify and govern both our hearts and minds in 
the ways of Thy laws and in the works of Thy com- 
mandments: that through Thy most mighty protec- 
tion, both here and ever, we may be pure in body 
and in soul, through Christ our Lord, Who with Thee 
and the Father liveth and reigneth for ever. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the twelfth chapter of 
the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corin- 
thians, beginning at the first verse. 


CONCERNING spiritual gifts, brethren, I would 
not have you ignorant. There are diversities of 
gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are differences

of administrations, but the same Lord. And there 
are diversities of operations, but it is the same God 
which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of 
the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. 
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, 
to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 
to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the 
gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the 
working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another 
discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of 
tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues; 
put all these worketh that one and the self-same 
Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the twelfth chapter 
of that according to St. Mark, beginning at the 
twenty-eighth verse. 


ONE of the scribes came and asked Jesus: Which 
is the first commandment of all? And Jesus answer- 
ed him: The first of all the commandments is: Hear, O 
Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord; and thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all 
thy strength; this is the first commandment, and the 
second is like unto it, namely, this: Thou shalt love 
thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other com- 
mandment greater than these. And the scribe said 
unto Him: Well, Master, Thou hast said the truth; 
for there is one God, and there is none other but 
He; and to love Him with all the heart, and with 
all the understanding and with all the soul, and with 
all the strength, and to love his neighbour as him- 
self, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sac- 
rifices. And when Jesus saw that he answered dis- 
creetly, He said unto him: Thou art not far from 
the kingdom of God. 


QUINQUAGESIMA 51 


The Sunday called Ouingquagesina, or 
the next Sunday before Lent 
Intent: The HOLY SPIRIT: as the Fire of Love 


The Collect 


O HOLY Spirit, Who hast taught us that all our 
doings without love are nothing worth, pour into 
our hearts that most excellent gift of love, the very 
bond of peace, and of all virtues, without which who- 
soever liveth is counted dead before Thee, Who livest 
and reignest with the Father and the Son, one God 
for evermore. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the thirteenth chapter 
of the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the 
Corinthians, beginning at the first verse. 


THOUGH I speak with the tongues of men and 
of Angels, and have not love, I am become as sound- 
ing brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have 
the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, 
and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that 
I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am 
nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed 
the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, 
and have not love, it profiteth me nothing. Love 
suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love 
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not be- 
have itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not 
easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in 
iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, 
believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all 
things. Love never faileth; .but whether there be 
prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, 
they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it 
shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we 
prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect 


52 QUINQUAGESIMA 


Oe 
is come, then that which is in part shall be done 
away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I 
understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when 
I became a man, I put away childish things. For 
now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face 
to face; now I know in part, but then shall I know 
even as I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, 
love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the twentieth chapter 
of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the 
first verse. 


THE kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that 
is an householder, which went out early in the morn- 
ing to hire labourers into his vineyard. And when 
he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, 
he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out 
about the third hour, and saw others standing idle 
in the marketplace, and said unto them: Go ye also 
into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will 
give you. And they went their way. Again he went 
out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. 
And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found 
others standing idle, and saith unto them: Why 
stand ye here all the day idle? They say unto him: 
Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them: 
Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, 
that shall ye receive. So when even was come, the 
lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward: Call 
the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning 
from the last unto the first. And when they came that 
were hired about the eleventh hour, they received 
every man a penny. But when the first came, they 
supposed that they should have received more; and 
they likewise received every man a penny. And when 
they had received it, they murmured against the 
goodman of the house, saying: These last have 





FIRST DAY OF LENT 53 





wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal 
unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of 
the day. But he answered one of them, and said: 
Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst not thou agree 
with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy 
way; I will give unto this last even as unto thee. 
Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine 
own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? So 
the last shall be first, and the first last; for many 
be called, but few chosen. 


This Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve until the 
First Day of Lent.

The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the third chapter of the Acts of the 
Apostles, beginning at the nineteenth verse. 


REPENT ye therefore, and be converted, that your 
sins may be blotted out when the times of refresh- 
ing shall come from the presence of the Lord. And 
He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preach- 
ed unto you; Whom the heaven must receive until 
the times of restitution of all things, which God hath 
spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since 


54 ‘ FIRST DAY OF LENT 


OF 
the world began. For Moses truly said unto the 
fathers: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise 
up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; Him shall 
ye hear in all things whatsoever He shall say unto 
you. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel, and 
those that follow after, as many as have spoken, 
have likewise foretold of these days. Ye are the 
children of the prophets, and of the covenant which 
God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham: 
And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth 
be blessed. Unto you first, God, having raised up 
His Son Jesus, sent Him to bless you, in turning away 
every one of you from his iniquities.

The holy Gospel is taken from the third chapter 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the third 
verse. 


JESUS said unto Nicodemus: Amen, I say unto 
thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the 
kingdom of God. Nicodemus said unto Him: How 
can a man be born when he is old? And Jesus an- 
swered: Amen, Amen, I say unto thee, except a 
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot 
enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born 
of the fiesh is flesh, and that which is born of the 
Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, 
ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where 
it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but 
canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth; 
so is everyone that is born of the Spirit. Nicodemus 
said; How can these things be? Jesus answered: 
Amen, Amen, I say unto thee, we speak that we do 
know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive 
not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, 
and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you 
of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up 
to heaven but He that came down from heaven, even 


FIRST SUNDAY IN LENT 55 





the Son of Man which is in heaven. And as Moses 
lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must 
the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever be- 
lieveth in Him should not perish, but have eternal 
life. 

The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for 
every day after, unto the next Sunday.

amine ourselves that, discerning clearly our faults, 
we may truly amend them, and thus prepare our-

The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the fifth chapter of the 
Second Epistle of St. Paul. the Apostle to the Corin- 
thians, beginning at the ninth verse. 


WE labour that we may be accepted of Him, for 
we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, 
that every one may receive the things done in his 
body, according to that he hath done, whether it be 
good or bad. The love of Christ constraineth us; 
therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new crea- 
ture; old things are passed away; behold, all things 
are become new. Give no offence in anything, in all 
things approving yourselves by pureness, by know-

whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. 
Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live

The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the third chapter 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the six- 
teenth verse. oe 


GOD so loved the world that He gave His alone-born 
Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, 
but have everlasting life. For God sent not His Son 
into the world to condemn the world, but that the 
world through Him might be saved. He that 
believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that be- 
lieveth not is condemned already, because he hath 
not believed in the Name of the alone-born Son of 
God. And this is the condemnation, that light is 
come into the world, and men loved darkness rather 
than light, because their deeds were evil. For every- 
one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh 
to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But 
he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds 
may be made manifest, that they are wrought in 
God.

SECOND SUNDAY IN LENT 57 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the third chapter of the 
Epistle General of St. James, beginning at the second 
verse. 





IF any man offend not in word, the same is a 
perfect man, and able to bridle the whole body. For 
every kind of beasts and of birds, and of serpents 
and of things in the sea, hath been tamed of man- 
kind; but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly 
evil, full of deadly poison. The tongue is a little 
member, but it boasteth great things. Behold, how 
great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue 
is a fire, a world of iniquity; so is the tongue among 
our members that it defileth the whole body, and 
setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on 
fire of hell. Therewith bless we God, even the Father, 
and therewith curse we men, who are made after the 
similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceed- 
eth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things 
ought not so to be. If any man among you seem to 
be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but de- 
ceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the sixth chapter 
of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the 
forty-first verse. 


WHY beholdest thou the mote that is in thy bro- 
ther’s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in 
thine own eye ? How canst thou say to thy brother: 
Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine 
eye; when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that 
is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first 
the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou 
see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother’s 
eye. For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt

for of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble- 
push gather they grapes. A good man out of the 
good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which 
is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of 
his heart bringeth forth that which is evil; for of 
the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

O GOD Who knowest all things, and art therefore

hearts of our brethren that we may never fail in

The Epistle is taken from the third chapter of the 
First Epistle General of St. Peter, beginning at the

BE ye all of one mind, having compassion one on 
another; love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous; 
not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, 
but contrariwise blessing, knowing that ye are there- 
unto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. For 
he that will love life and see good days, let him 
refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak 
no guile. Let him eschew evil and do good; let him 
seek peace, and ensue it. And above all things have 
fervent charity among yourselves; for charity shall 
cover the multitude of sins.

The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the eighth chapter 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the third 
verse. 





THE Pharisees brought unto Jesus a2 woman who 
had been unfaithful to her husband, and when they 
had set her in the midst, they said unto Him: Master, 
this woman was taken in impurity, in the very act; 
now Moses in the Law commanded us that such should 
be stoned; but what sayest Thou ? This they said, 
tempting Him, that they might have wherewith to 
accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down, and with His 
finger wrote on the ground, as though He heard them 
not. So when they continued asking Him, He lifted 
Himself up, and said unto them: He that is without 
sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And 
again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. 
And they who heard it, being convicted by their own 
conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the 
eldest, even unto the last; and Jesus was left alone, 
and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus 
had lifted Himself up, and saw none but the woman, 
He said unto her: Woman, where are those thine 
accusers ? Hath no man condemned thee? She said: 
No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her: Neither do 
I condemn thee; go, and sin no more.

The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the fourth chapter of 
that of St. Paul the Apostle to the Philippians, be- 
ginning at the eleventh verse. 


I HAVE learned, in whatsoever state I am, there- 
with to be content. I know both how to be abased, 
and I know how to abound; everywhere and in all 
things I am instructed both to be full and to be 
hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do 
all things through Christ Who strengtheneth me. 
Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever 
things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatso- 
ever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, 
whatsoever things are of good report: if there be 
any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these 
things. Those things, which ye have both learned, 
and received, and heard, and seen in me, do; and the 
God of peace shall be with you. Rejoice in the Lord 
alway; and again I say, Rejoice. Let your moderation 
be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand, and 
the peace of God which passeth all understanding 
shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ 
Jesus. 

Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the sixth chapter 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the third 
verse. 


JESUS went up into a mountain, and there He sat 
with His disciples. And when He lifted up His eyes, 
and saw a great company come unto Him, He saith 
unto Philip: Whence shall we buy bread, that these 
may eat? Philip answered: Two hundred penny- 


FIFTH SUNDAY IN LENT 61 





worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every 
one of them may take a little. One of His disciples, 
Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto Him: There 
is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two 
small fishes; but what are they among so many ? 
Jesus said: Make the men sit down. Now there was 
much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in 
number about five thousand. And Jesus took the 
loaves; and when He had given thanks, He distri- 
buted to the disciples, and the disciples to them that 
were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as 
they would. When they were filled, he said unto 
His disciples: Gather up the fragments that remain, 
that nothing be lost. Therefore they gathered them 
together, and filled twelve baskets with the frag- 
ments of the five barley loaves which remained over 
and above unto them that had eaten. Then those 
men, when they had seen this miracle which Jesus 
did, said: This is of a truth that prophet which 
should come into the world.

The Collect 


O LORD, Who didst lay aside Thy glory, and take 
upon Thee the earthly robe of mortal flesh, we pray 
for wisdom to avoid the specious snare of pride, and 
ever to walk humbly and heedfully in Thy sight, 
Who livest and reignest with the Father and the 
Holy Ghost throughout all ages of ages. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 
The Epistle is taken from the twelfth chapter of 





62 FIFTH SUNDAY IN LENT 





that of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans, begin- 
ning at the second verse. 


BE not conformed to this world, but be ye trans- 
formed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may 
prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect 
will of God. For I say to every man that is among 
you not to think of himself more highly than he 
ought to think, but to think soberly according as 
God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 
For as we have many members in one body, and all 
members have not the same office, so we, being many, 
are one body in Christ, and every one members one of 
another. Having then gifts differing according to 
the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let 
us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or 
ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he that 
teacheth, on teaching, or he that exhorteth, on ex- 
hortation. He that giveth, let him do it with sim- 
plicity; -he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth 
mercy, with cheerfulness. Dearly beloved, avenge 
not yourselves, for it is written: Vengeance is Mine, 
I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thine 
enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him 
drink; in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon 
his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil 
with good. 

Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the eighteenth chap- 
ter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the 
ninth verse. 


HE spake this parable unto certain which trusted 
in themselves that they were righteous, and despised 
others: Two men went up into the temple to pray; 
the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The 
Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: God, 
I thank Thee that I am not as other men are, extor- 
tioners, unjust, or even as this publican. I fast 


PALM SUNDAY 63 





- twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. 
And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift 
up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon 
* his breast, saying: God be merciful to me, a sinner. 
I tell you, this man went down to his house justified 
rather than the other; for every one that exalteth 
himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth him- 
self shall be exalted. And they brought unto Him 
also infants, that He should touch them; but when 
His disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus 
called them unto Him, and said: Suffer little children 
to come unto Me, and forbid them not; for of such 
is the kingdom of God. Amen, I say unto you: Who- 
soever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little 
child shall in no wise enter therein. 


Che Sunday Next before Easter, or 
Palm Sunday 


The Blessing of the Palms 


The procession enters as usual. Upon reaching the 
chancel the palm branches upon the table are uncover- 
ed. The antiphon ‘‘Hosanna Filio David’’ is then 
sung, as followeth: 


Priest. Hosanna to the Son of David: blessed 
is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord. 


People. O King of Israel: Hosanna in the highest. 


The Priest sprinkles the palms thrice with holy water 
and says: 


Let us pray. 
The people kneel. 





64 PALM SUNDAY 


O God, Who gatherest the things that are dispersed, 
and preservest what is gathered; Thou that didst 
bless the people, who, bearing branches, went out 
to meet Jesus; do Thou also + purify and + bless 
these boughs of palm which Thy servants faithfully 
take up in honour of Thy Name, that unto what place 
soever these branches be brought, the dwellers there- 
in may obtain Thy blessing, and, every adversity 
being chased therefrom, Thy right Hand may pro- 
tect those whom Thy Son Christ doth watch over 
and love. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The people are seated. 


The Priest blesses incense and censes the palms thrice. 
He then turns to the people and says: 


Receive a branch of palm, ye who desire to greet 
the Lord with joy and gladness. 


The branches are now distributed to the clergy and 
the people; a branch is fastened to the top of the pro- 
cessional cross. The procession forms in the chancel 
and the Priest sings: 


P. Let us go forth in peace. 
Cc. In the Name of Christ. s 


The procession moves through the church and out of 
the door singing an appropriate hymn.* The door is 
closed at the end of the hymn, and the people within 
turn in tts direction and sing the first verse of ‘‘ All 
glory, laud, and honour.’’ This verse is repeated by 
those without the door. The people and choir 
then sing the neat verse, and those on the outside re- 
peat the refrain, which is the same as the first verse. 
This ts done alternately throughout the whole of the 
verses, all, however, joining in the refrain after the 
last verse. The cross-bearer then knocks at the church 
door with the base of the processional cross; the door 
is immediately opened, and the procession enters singing 
some appropriate hymn. The Holy Hucharist now be- 
gins as usual. 


* Hymn 132 is suitable. 





PALM SUNDAY — 65 


The Collect 

O LORD Christ, before Whom in Thy one earthly 
triumph the children of the Hebrews did cast their 
votive palms, grant unto Thy faithful servants that 
in Thine own good time we too may bear the palm 
of victory, and may be found worthy to stand in Thy» 
holy Presence, Thou Who dwellest ever in the unity 
of the Father and the Holy Spirit throughout all 
ages of ages. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the nineteenth chapter of the Revelation 
ef St. John the Divine, beginning at the first verse. 


I HEARD a great voice of much people in heaven 
saying: Alleluia; salvation and glory and honour 
and power unto the Lord our God, for true and right- 
eous are His judgments. And again they said Al- 
leluia. And the four-and-twenty elders and the four 
beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the 
Throne, saying: Amen, Alleluia; and a voice came 
out of the Throne saying: Praise our God, all ye 
His servants and ye that love Him, both small and 
sreat. And I heard as it were the voice of a great 
multitude, and as the voice of many waters, -and 
as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying: Alleluia; 
for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth: let us be glad 
und rejoice and give honour to Him. And I saw heaven 
ypened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon 
him was called Faithful and True. His eyes were 
us a flame of fire, and on His Head were many crowns; 
4nd His name is called The Word of God; and He hath 
yn His vesture and on His thigh a name written: King 
9f Kings and Lord of Lords. 

Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 
The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-first chap- 
fer of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the 
first verse.

66 HOLY WEEK SERVICES. 





WHEN they drew nigh unto Jerusalem and were | 
come to Bethphage unto the Mount of Olives, then | 
sent Jesus two disciples, saying unto them: Go unto — 
the village over against you, and straightway ye | 
shall find an ass tied and a colt with her; loose them — 
and bring them unto Me. And if any man say ~ 
aught unto you, ye shall say: The Lord hath need | 
of them; and straightway he will send them. And 
the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them, | 
and brought the ass and the colt, and put on them — 
their clothes, and they set Him thereon. And a very — 
great multitude spread their garments in the way; 
others cut down branches from the trees and strewed — 
them in the way. And the multitude that went be- 
fore and that followed cried saying: Hosanna to 
the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the 
Name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest. And 
when He was come into Jerusalem all the city was 
moved saying: Who is this? And the multitude 
said: This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth in Gali- 
lee. 





The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for 
every day until Maundy Thursday. 


NOTE ON HOLY WEEK SERVICES | 


The traditional services at the conclusion of Holy 
Week, in which the successive events in the mystery- 
drama of the Gospels from Thursday to Easter Sunday 
are portrayed, are an interesting survival of primitive 
rites of the Church. 


Maundy Thursday takes its name from the opening 
words of the antiphon Mandatum novum do vobis 
(‘fa new commandment I give unto you’’), which in- 
troduces the ancient ceremony of the washing of the © 
feet. Apart from this ceremony, which is not observed 
among us, the day is kept in honour of the institution 
of the Holy Eucharist, and the Celebration is one of 
festal splendour, with procession of the Blessed Sacra- 
ment. On this day also the Bishop, in his cathedral 


HOLY WEEK SERVICES 67 





church, consecrates the Holy Oils to be used for the 
succeeding year. 


. On Good Friday the Church commemorates the solemn 
event of the crucifixion in the mystery-drama. From 
the evening of Maundy Thursday the church is stripped 
of earthly pomp and splendour, and there is no Cele- 
bration until that of the Resurrection on Easter morn- 
ing. Instead, on Friday and Saturday there is cele- 
brated the Eucharist of the Presanctified, in which the 
consecration is omitted, the Priest receiving a Host 
consecrated or ‘‘presanctified’’ on Maundy Thursday. 


The traditional offices of this and the following day 
are protracted by the reading of long passages from the 
Old Testament, but these are not part of our rite. In 
the Eastern Church a Mass of the Presanctified is en- 
joined for all days in Lent, except Saturdays and Sun- 
days. 


In ancient times the people spent the night before 
Baster in prayer and watching. During this night the 
water in the baptismal font was blessed and catechu- 
mens were baptized in readiness to share in the Cele- 
bration of the Resurrection at dawn. In preparation 
for all this, long discourses and scripture readings were 
given for the edification of the faithful. Part of the 
symbolism, also, was the blessing of the new fire, and 
the lighting therefrom of the paschal candle and the 
lamps of the church. During the middle ages a ten- 
dency to anticipate liturgical events came increasingly 
and irresistibly into evidence, and now the Roman 
Catholic Church celebrates the Mass of Resurrection, 
‘as well as the blessing of the new fire and of the bap- 
tismal font, on the Saturday morning. 


The Liberal Catholic rite has reverted to the older 
and surely sounder usage of not celebrating the Hucharist 
of the Resurrection until Easter morning.

Maundy Chursday 


White: vestments are used, and the purple veil cov- 
ering the cross during Holy Week is replaced by one of | 
white. 


The Collect 


O GOD, Who in this wonderful Sacrament hast left 
us a perpetual memorial of Thy love; may we, by the 
inspiration of Thy Holy Spirit, so reverence the sacred 
mysteries of Thy Body and Blood, that we may the _ 
more worthily receive this Thy most glorious gift and 
blessing. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the eleventh chapter of the 
First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinth- 
ians, beginning at the twenty-third verse. 


FOR I have received of the Lord that which also I 
delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same 
night in which He was betrayed, took bread, and when 
He had given thanks, He brake it, and said: Take, 
eat; this is My Body, which is broken for you; this 
do in remembrance of Me. After the same manner 
also He took the cup, when He had supped, saying: 
This cup is the new testament in My Blood; this do 
ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of Me. For 
as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, 
ye do show the Lord’s death till He come. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 4 


The holy Gospel is taken from the sixth chapter of 
that according to St. John, beginning at the forty- 
seventh verse. 


AMEN, Amen, I say unto you, he that believeth 
on Me hath everlasting life. I am that Bread of 


MAUNDY THURSDAY 69 





life. This is the Bread which cometh down from 
heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I 
am the living Bread which came down from heaven; 
if any man eat of this Bread, he shall live for ever: 
and the Bread that I will give is My Flesh, which I 
will give for the life of the world. ‘The Jews ~ 
therefore strove among themselves, saying: How can 
this man give us his flesh to eat? Then Jesus said 
unto them: Amen, Amen, I say unto you, except ye 
eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His Blood, 
ye have no life in you; whoso eateth My Flesh and 
drinketh My Blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise 
him up at the last day. For My Flesh is meat indeed, 
and My Blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My 
Flesh, and drinketh My Blood, dwelleth in Me, and I 
in him. As the living Father hath sent Me, and I 
live by the Father; so he that eateth Me even he 
shall live by Me. This is that Bread which came down 
from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and 
are dead: he that eateth of this Bread shall live for 
ever. 

Four large Hosts are consecrated, one for this Cele- 
bration, the other three for subsequent use. 





During the singing of the Adeste Fideles, the Blessed 
Sacrament is carried round the church in procession in 
the monstrance. 


If this hymn be not long enough, tt should be sup- 
plemented by some. other Eucharistic hymn. 





At evening a ciborium containing the three Hosts is 
carried out, in solemn procession if there be an evening 
service. These, together with some Particles for pos- 
sible use of the sick, should be reserved in a taber- 
nacle in the sacristy or some other convenient place out 
of the church. Two of these Hosts are required for 
the Masses of the Presanctified on Good Friday and 
Holy Saturday respectively, and the third is to be placed 
in the tabernacle of the high Altar before the first 


eae GOOD FRIDAY 





Celebration on Easter Day, or on Saturday evening, if 
the first Vespers of Easter and Benediction be celebrated. 


After the evening service the Altars are stripped of — 
flowers, cloths and frontals, the tabernacle door left 
open, and the cross again veiled in violet. 





The Office of Blessing the Oils on Maundy Thursday 
will be found later in this Book. 





Gond Friday 


The Altar is covered with a plain linen cloth and 
violet frontal, but otherwise unadorned. No candles 
are lighted. If convenient, Prime may be sung before 
the special service of the Day. If that be done the lec- 
tions which follow shall be used as the First and Sec- 
ond Lessons at Prime in place of the Epistle and Gos- 
pel. 


The First Lesson. 


The First Lesson is taken from the fifty-eighth 
Chapter of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, beginning 
at the third verse. 


Wherefore have we fasted, men say, and Thou 
seeest not ? Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and 
Thou takest no knowledge? Is it such a fast that I 
have chosen? saith the Lord. A day for a man to 
afflict his soul, to bow down his head as a bulrush, 
and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Wilt 
thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the 
Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen—to 
loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy 
burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye 
break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to 
the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast 
out to thine house, and when thou seest the naked 


GOOD FRIDAY 71 


that thou cover him? ‘Then shall thy light break 
forth as the morning and thy health shall spring forth 
speedily, and thy righteousness shall go before thee; 
and the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward. 


Here endeth the First Lesson. 


The Second Lesson. 


. The Second Lesson is taken from the twelfth Chap- 
ter of the Gospel according to St. John, beginning at 
the twenty-third verse. 

Jesus said: The hour is come that the Son of Man 
should be glorified. Amen, Amen, I say unto you, 
except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die 
it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much 
fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it, and he 
that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto 
life eternal. If any man serve Me, let him follow Me; 
and where I am, there shall also My servant be. 


Here endeth the Second Lesson. 
EUCHARIST OF THE PRESANCTIFIED. 
The Collect 


LORD Christ, Whose life Thy Church doth lay be- 
fore us as a perfect ensample for our imitation, grant 
us that we may have strength soto follow Thee through 
suffering and mystical death, that we may rise with 
Thee into the ineffable splendour of Easter, Who liv- 
est and reignest throughout the ages of ages. R. 
Amen. 


The Collects for Ash Wednesday and for Peace are 
then said, and the Epistle and Gospel follow in the usual 
form. 

The Epistle 


The Hpistle is taken from the first chapter of the 
Second Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corin- 
thians, beginning at the third verse. 


72 GOOD FRIDAY 


BLESSED be God, even the Father of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all 
comfort, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that 
we may be able to comfort them which are in any 
trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are 
comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ 
abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by | 
Christ. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your conso- 
lation and salvation, which is effectual in the endur- 
ing of the same sufferings which we also suffer; or 
whether we be comforted, that also is for your conso- 
lation and salvation. And our hope of you is stead- 
fast, knowing that as ye are partakers of the suffer- 
ings, so shall ye be also of the consolation. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the ninth chapter 
of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the eight- 
eenth verse. 


AND Jesus asked His disciples: Whom say the people 
that Iam? They answering said: John the Baptist; 
but some say Elias; and others say that one of the old 
prophets is risen again. He said unto them: But 
whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said: The 
Christ of God. And He straitly charged them, and com- 
manded them to tell to no man that thing, saying: The 
Son of Man must suffer many things, and be re- 
jected by the elders and chief priests and Scribes, and © 
be slain, and be raised the third day. And He said 
to them all: If any man will come after Me, let him 
deny himself and take up his cross daily, and follow 
Me. For whosoever doth not bear his cross and come 
after Me, cannot be My disciple. Likewise, whoso- 
ever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, | 
he cannot be My disciple. For whosoever will save 
his life shall lose it; but whosoever will lose his life 
for My sake, the same shall save it. 


The sermon, if there is to be one, follows here. 





GOOD FRIDAY 73 
_ The Priest (or deacon) now places the cross upon the 
centre of the Altar, and as it is unveiled the people kneel. 
The. officiant, other clergy and ministers approach the 
Altar from the farther end of the sanctuary or chancel by 
three stages; at the end of each stage they genu- 
flect. During the first genuflection the following ver- 
Sicle* and response are sung: 


P. Holy art Thou, O God. 

C. Holy art Thou, O God. 
During the second genuflection: 

P. Holy art Thou, O Mighty One. 
C. Holy art thou, O Mighty One. 
During the third genuflection: 


_ RP. Holy art Thou, O Immortal One; pour out. 
Thy love upon us, 

C. Holy art Thou, O Immortal One; pour out Thy 
love upon us. 

| This last genuflection having taken place, the follow- 
img hymn is sung: 

| 

_ *These phrases are a translation of the ancient Tris- 
agion (‘‘thrice-holy’’) of the Greek Liturgy. In the 
traditional Latin rite these Greek and Latin phrases 
are sung antiphonally, as follows: 


Hagios O Theos. 

Sanctus Deus. 

Hagios Ischyros. 

Sanctus Fortis. 

Hagios Athanatos, eleison hemas. 
Sanctus Immortalis, miserere nobis. 








Apart from the Kyrie eleison, this is the only in- 
stance of the use of Greek in the Roman rite. Greek 
was the original liturgical language at Rome, and 
Greck and Latin are the two ancient liturgical lan- 
guages of the Church. 





74 GOOD FRIDAY 


TAKE up thy cross, our Master said, 
If thou would’st My disciple be; 
Deny thyself, the world forsake, 
And humbly follow after Me. 


Take up thy cross; let not its weight 
Fill thy weak spirit with alarm; 

His strength shall bear thy spirit up, 
And brace thy heart, and nerve thine arm. 


Take up thy cross, nor heed the shame, 
Nor let thy foolish pride rebel; 

Thy Lord for thee the cross endured, 
To save thy soul from death’s dark spell. 


Take up thy cross, and follow Christ, 
Nor think till death to lay it down; 
For only he who bears the cross 
May hope to wear the glorious crown. 


To Thee, great Lord, the One in Three, 
All praise for evermore ascend; 
O grant us in our Home to see 
The heavenly life that knows no end. Amen. 


Towards the end. of the hymn the candles are lighted 
on the Altar, and lastly the cross is moved back to tts 
accustomed place. A procession is formed, and 
returns with lights and incense to the high Altar, the 
celebrant bearing a ciborium containing a Host con- 
secrated on the previous day. The Host is placed on 
the corporal; wine and water are poured into the chal- 
ice, but without the usual prayers. The Priest censes 
the offerings and the Altar in the usual way. Having 
washed his fingers im silence, he says: 


ORATE FRATRES. 


Brethren, pray that my sacrifice and yours may 
be acceptable to God the Father Almighty. 


a re ee 


GOOD FRIDAY 75 





_ C. May the Lord receive the sacrifice at thy hands, 
and sanctify our lives in His service, 


He continues: 


O Lord, we offer and present unto Thee ourselves, 
our souls and bodies, to be a holy and continual sac- 
rifice unto Thee. May our strength be spent in Thy 
service and our love poured forth upon Thy people. 
R. Amen. 


The Priest proceeds wmmediately to the following 
prayers: 

P. We praise and thank Thee, holy Lord, for the 
glory of Thy saints, and we (here he makes the sign 
of the holy cross with the paten from his forehead to 
his breast) join with them in worship before Thy great 
white throne, whence flow all love and light and bless- 
ing through all the worlds which Thou hast made. 


He elevates the Host for the adoration of the people. 
Immediately he breaks the Host over the chalice in the 
usual way, dropping the Particle into the chalice, but 
in silence. He then says: 


- O Thou Who in this adorable Sacrament hast left 
us a living memorial and pledge of Thy marvellous 
love for mankind, and dost therein graciously draw 
us into wondrous and mystic communion with Thee; 
grant us so to receive the sacred mysteries of Thy 
Body and Blood that our souls may be lifted into the 
immensity of Thy love, and that, being filled with a 
high endeavour, we may ever be mindful of Thine 
indwelling Presence and breathe forth the fragrance 
of a holy life. BR. Amen. 
Ihe Priest consumes the sacred Host in the usual 
manner, after which in silence he recewes the contents 
of the chalice. 
- He concludes with the following Postcommunio 
prayer : - 

We pray Thee, O Lord, that Thy grace may he 
so grafted inwardly in our hearts, that it-may con- 


76 HOLY SATURDAY 


tinually be made manifest in our lives. Through 
Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Altar cloth is removed. 





At evening Complin may be said. 





Goly Saturday 


The Altar is covered with a plain linen cloth and 
violet frontal, but otherwise unadorned. No candles 
are yet lighted. The colour is violet. 

If convenient, Prime may be sung before the special 
service of the Day. If that be done, the lections which 
follow shall be used as the First and Second Lessons 
at Prime in place of the Epistle and Gospel. 


The First Lesson. 


The First Lesson is taken from the thirty-seventh 
Psalm of King David, beginning at the third verse. 


Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: 
delight thou in the Lord, and He shall give thee thy 
heart’s desire. Commit thy way unto the Lord, and 
put thy trust in Him, and He shall bring it to pass. 
He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light, 
and thy just dealing as the noonday. O rest in the 
Lord; wait patiently for Him; for the meek shall in- 
herit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the 
abundance of peace. : 


Here endeth the First Lesson. 
The Second Lesson. 


The Second Lesson is taken from the fourteenth 
Chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, begin- 
ning at the first verse. 


Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, 
believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many 
mansions; if it were not so I would have told you. I 
go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and pre-

pare a place for you, I will come again and receive 
you unto Myself, that where I am there ye may be 
‘also. Now, I have told you before it come to pass, 
that when it is come to pass ye might believe. Peace 
I leave with you, My peace I give unto you; not as 
the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your 
heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 


Here endeth the Second Lesson. 
THE BLESSING OF THE FIRE. 


At a convenient time before the service fire is kind- 
led outside the Church. It is desirable that the tin- 
der from which this fire is ignited should be lighted 
from the sun by means of a lens, but if that be not 
possible, flint and steel should be used. 


The service begins with the Asperges. Then a pro- 
cession is formed which moves to the door of the 
Church. The glowing embers are placed in an 
appropriate vessel, such as an open thurible, The Priest 
blesses the new fire in this wise: 


Let this fire be + purified and + blessed by Him 
in Whose honour it is kindled. 


Some charcoal for burning incense is lighted from 
the new fire and placed im another thurible. 


Five pellets of incense are blessed. 


P. Let this incense be + purified and + blessed 
by Him to Whom its fragrance is dedicated. 


The triple candle is lighted from the new fire and 
blessed. 


P. Let this candle be + purified and + blessed 
by Him Who is the Light of the world. 


- The procession returns. If there be a subdeacon 
and deacon, the former bears the five grains of incense. 
The deacon, who in the meantime has been vested in 
a white dalmatic, bears the triple candle, lighted from 





78 HOLY SATURDAY 


the new fire. Otherwise an attendant bears the in- 
cense, and the Priest takes the candle. During the pro- — 
cession four genuflections are made by all who take 
part therein. At each the deacon raises the triple 
candle and sings: 


Deacon. Christ is our Light. 
Cc. May His Light shine in our hearts. 


The procession having arrived at the Altar, the 
deacon says: 


Cleanse my heart and my lips, O God, Who by the 
hand of Thy Seraph didst cleanse the lips of the 
prophet Isaiah with a burning coal from Thine Altar, 
and in Thy lovingkindness so purify me that I may 
worthily proclaim Thy holy gospel. Through Christ 
our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Priest blesses him in the usual manner: 

May the Lord be in thy + heart and on thy + 
lips, that through thy heart the love of God may shine 
forth, and through thy lips His power be made mani- 
fest. R. Amen. 


D. The Lord be with you. 


Cc. And with thy spirit. 


D. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word 
was with God, andthe Word was God.. The same was 
in the beginning with God. All things were made by 
Him, and without Him was not anything made that 
was made. In Him was life, and the life was the 
light of men; and the light shineth in darkness 
and the darkness comprehended it not. 


There was a man sent from God, whose name was 
John. This man came for a witness, to bear wit- 
ness of the Light, that all might believe through. 
him. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear 
witness of that Light. That was the true Light 
which lighteth every man that cometh into this world. 





HOLY SATURDAY 79 


He was in the world, and the world was made by 
Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto 
_His own, and His own received Him not. But as 
“many as received Him, to them gave He power to 
become the sons of God, even to them that believe on 

His Name; which were born, not of blood, nor of 
_ the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of 

God. (All now genuflect.) And the Word was made 
Flesh (all rise again), and dwelt among us, and we 
beheld His glory, the glory as of the alone-born Son 
of the Father, full of grace and truth. 





The deacon now fixes into the paschal candle the 
five grains of incense, and the Priest blesses the candle, 
saying: 


Let this candle be + purified and + blessed by 
Him in Whose honour it shall be burned. 


The deacon lights the paschal candle and Altar candles 
from the triple candle, and also any other lamps of the . 
church (save that which burns before the Blessed Sac- 
rament). 


P. Let us pray. 


Blessed Lord, may our hearts be so stirred by Thy 
power during this Easter Festival that, arising from 
the darkness of sin and ignorance, we may shine 
with the splendour of Thy light, O Thou Who art 
eur Sun of Righteousness. R. Amen. 


The deacon resumes the violet dalmatic. If it be 
convenient, a baptism may now be performed, im ac- 
cordance with the ancient custom of the Church. 


After the water has been blessed in the usual man- 
ner, the Priest lowers the base of the triple candle into 
the water and makes with it the sign of the cross in the 
water thrice, saying: 

In the Name of the + Father, and of the + Son, 
and of the Holy + Ghost. BR. Amen. 


80 HOLY SATURDAY 


The baptism being ended, the Eucharist of the Pre- 
sanctified follows. It begins with four Collects, the first 
from the ordinary Eucharistic service, the second as giv- — 
en below, the third that of Ash Wednesday, and the 
fourth the customary Prayer for Peace, after which the 
Epistle and Gospel are read as usual. 


The Collect 


LORD CHRIST, Whose Life Thy Church doth lay 
before us as a perfect ensample for our imitation, 
grant that we may follow Thee through mystic burial 
into newness of life, Who livest and reignest in eter- 
nal glory. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the third chapter of the 
First Epistle General of St. Peter, beginning at the 
fourteenth verse. 


BUT and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, hap- 
py are ye; and be not afraid of their terror, neither 
be troubled; but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, 
and be ready always to give an answer to every 
man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is 
in you; having a good conscience, that whereas they 
speak evil of you as of evildoers, they may be asham- 
ed that falsely accuse your good conversation in 
Christ. It is better, if the will of God be so, that 
ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing. For 
Christ also hath once suffered, being put to death in 
the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. By which also 
He went and preached to the spirits in prison, 
but now is gone into heaven, and is on the right 
hand of God, Angels and Authorities and Powers be- 
ing made subject unto Him. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


EASTER DAY 81 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-seventh 
chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning 
at the fifty-seventh verse. 


WHEN the even was come, there came a rich: 
man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself 
was Jesus’ disciple. He went to Pilate, and begged 
the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body 
to be delivered. And when Joseph had taken the 
body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid 
it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in 
the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of 
the sepulchre, and departed. And there was Mary 
Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against 
the sepulchre. Now the next day that followed the 
day of the preparation, the chief priests and Phari- 
sees came together unto Pilate, saying: Sir, we re- 
member that that deceiver said, while He was yet 
alive: After three days I will rise again. Command, 
therefore, that the sepulchre be made sure until the 
third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal 
Him away, and say unto the people: He is risen from 
the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the 
first. Pilate said unto them: Ye have a watch; go 
your way, make it as sure as ye can. So they went 
and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and 
setting a watch. 








The sermon, if there is to be one, is given here. Then 
the procession is formed to bring in the Presanctified 
Host, and the remainder of the service follows exactly 
the course of that of the preceding day. 


Easter Day 


The Collect 


O GOD of Love, we praise Thee, we bless Thee, 
with all our hearts do we thank Thee and magnify 
Thy name for this most holy and wondrous Festival 
of Easter, for in the glorious victory which in it is 


82 EASTER DAY 





commemorated and symbolized, Thou hast given us 
the sure and certain witness that good shall finally 
triumph over ill, and that death is but a gateway 
to the ineffable splendour of eternal life in Thee, O 
never-setting Sun of Righteousness, Who livest and 
‘reignest God for ever and ever. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the fifteenth chapter of the 
First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corin- 
thians, beginning at the twelfth verse. 


NOW if Christ be preached that He rose from the 
dead, how say some among you that there is no re- 
surrection of the dead?  SBut if there be no resur- 
rection of the dead, then is Christ not risen; and if 
Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain. But 
some man will say: How are the dead raised up, and 
with what body do they come? ‘That which thou 
sowest is not quickened except it die, and that which 
thou sowest, thou sowest not that body which shall 
be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of 
some other grain. But God giveth it a body as it 
hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own body. 
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in 
corruption; it is raised in incorruption. It is sown 
in dishonour; it is raised in glory. It is sown in 
weakness; it is raised in power. It is sown a natural 
body; it is raised a spiritual body. For there is a 
natural body, and there is a spirituai body. So this 
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal 
must put on immortality. O death, where is thy 
sting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be 
to God, Who giveth us the victory through our Lord 
Jesus Christ. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-eighth 
chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at 
the first verse. 


FIRST SUNDAY AFTER EASTER 83 


AS it began to dawn towards the first day of the 
week came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary 
to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great 
earthquake, for the Angel of the Lord descended from 
heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from 
the door and sat upon it. His countenance was like 
lightning, and his raiment white as snow, and for 
fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as 
dead men. And the Angel said unto the women: Fear 
not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus, Who was 
crucified. Why seek ye the living amidst the dead ? 
He is not here; He has risen, as He said. Come, 
see the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly 
and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead. 
And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with 
fear and great joy, and did run to bring His disciples 
word. And as they went to tell His disciples, be- 
hold, Jesus met them, saying: All hail. And they 
came and took Him by the feet, and worshipped 
Him.

O LORD Christ, by Whose eternal Sacrifice we 
exist, and in Whose victory we triumph, grant that,

The Epistle

PETER opened his mouth, and said: Of a truth I

84 FIRST SUNDAY AFTER EASTER 


every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh 
righteousness, is accepted with Him. The word which 
God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace 
by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all), that word (I say) 
ye know, which was published throughout all Judea, 
and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John 
preached; how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with 
the Holy Ghost, and with power; Who went about 
doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of 
the devil; for God was with Him. And we are wit- 
nesses of all things which He did, both in the land 
of the Jews and in Jerusalem; Whom they slew, and 
hanged on a tree; Him God raised up the third day, 
and showed Him openly; not to all the people, but 
unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who 
did eat and drink with Him after He rose from the 
dead. And He commanded us to preach unto the 
people, and to testify that it is He Who was ordained 
of God to. be the Judge of quick and dead, 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-fourth 
chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the 
thirteenth verse. 


BEHOLD, two of His disciples went that same 
day to a village called Emmaus, which was from 
Jerusalem about three-score furlongs. And they 
talked together of all these things which had hap- 
pened. And it came to pass that, while they com- 
muned together and reasoned, Jesus Himself drew 
near, and went with them. But their eyes’ were 
holden, that they should not know Him. And He 
said unto them: What manner of communications are 
these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and 
are sad? And the one of them, whose name was 
Cleopas, answering, said unto Him: Art thou only 
a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the 
things which are come to pass there in these days ? 


FIRST SUNDAY AFTER EASTER 85 


And He said unto them: What things? And they 
said unto Him: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, Who 
was a prophet mighty in deed and word, before 
God and all the people; and how the chief priests 
and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to 
death, and have crucified Him. But we trusted that 
it had been He which should have redeemed Israel; 
and, besides all this, to-day is the third day since 
these things were done. Yea, and certain women al- 
so of our company made us astonished, which were 
early at the sepulchre; and when they found not 
His body, they came, saying that they had also seen 
a vision of Angels, which said that He was alive. 
And certain of them which were with us went to 
the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had 
said; but Him they saw not. Then He said unto 
them: O fools and slow of heart to believe all that 
the prophets have spoken; ought not Christ to have 
suffered these things, and to enter into His glory ? 
And, beginning at Moses, and all the prophets, He 
expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things 
concerning Himself. And they drew nigh unto the 
village whither they went, and He made as though 
He would have gone further; but they constrained 
Him, saying: Abide with us, for it is towards even- 
ing, and the day is far spent. And He went in to 
tarry with them. And it came to pass, as He sat at 
meat with them, He took bread, and blessed it, and 
brake, and gave it to them. And their eyes were 
opened, and they knew Him, and He vanished out 
of their sight. And they said one to another: Did not 
our heart burn within us while He talked with us 
by the way, and while He opened to us the Scrip- 
tures? And they rose up the same hour with them, 
turned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered 
together, and them that were with them, saying: 
The Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared 
to Simon. And they told what things were done 
in the way, and how He was known of them in break- 


ing of bread.

Che Serond Sunday alter Easter 


The Collect 


O LORD Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, Who as 
at holy Hastertide didst rise from the darkness of 
death to shine with exceeding glory upon Thy people, 
hasten Thou Thy Coming, we pray Thee, that once 
more that brightness may rise upon our longing eyes, 
and that all the earth may be filled with Thy glory, 
even as the waters cover the sea, Thou Who dwellest 
ever in the unity of the Father and the Holy Ghost 
throughout all ages of ages. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Hpistle is taken from the fifth chapter of the 
First Epistle General of St. John, beginning at the 
fourth verse. 


WHATSOEVER is born of God overcometh the 
world; and this is the victory that overcometh the 
world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh 
the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the 
Son of God ? This is He that came by water and blood, 
even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water 
and blood; and it is the Spirit that beareth witness, 
because the Spirit is truth. For there are Three that 
bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and 
the Holy Ghost; and these Three are One. And this 
is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life; 
and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son 
hath life; and he that hath not the Son hath not 
life.

Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them: 
Peace be unto you. And when He had so said, He 
showed unto them His hands and His side. Then 
were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. 
Then said Jesus to them again: Peace be unto you; 
as My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you. And 
when He had said this, He breathed on them, and 
saith unto them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose- 
soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; 
and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.

Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been 
taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. For 
in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bod- 
ily; and ye are complete in Him, Who is the Head 
of all principality and power; buried with Him in 
baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him through 
the faith of the operation of God, Who hath raised 
Him from the dead. If ye then be risen with Christ, 
seek those things which are above, where Christ

These are the words which I spake unto you while I 
was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled 
which were written in the law of Moses and in the 
Prophets and in the Psalms concerning Me. Then 
opened He their understanding, that they might un- 
derstand the Scriptures, and said unto them: Thus 
it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, 
and to rise from the dead the third day; and that 
repentance and remission of sins should be preached 
in His Name among all nations, beginning at Jeru- 
salem. And ye are witnesses of these things.

from the tree, and laid Him in a sepulchre. But 
God raised Him from the dead, and He was seen 
many days of them which came up with Him from 
Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses unto the 
people. And we declare unto you glad tidings, how

the rising of the sun. And they said among them- 
selves: Who shall roll us away the stone from the 
door of the sepulchre? And when they looked they 
saw that the stone was rolled away; for it was very 
great. And, entering into the sepulchre, they saw a 
young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long 
white garment, and they were affrighted. And he 
saith unto them: Be not affrighted; ye seek Jesus 
of Nazareth Which was crucified. He is risen; He is 
- not here; behold the place where they laid Him. 
But go your way, tell His disciples and Peter that 
He goes before you into Galilee: there shall ye see 
Him, as He said unto you.

YE men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of 
Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by 
miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by 
Him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: 
Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and 
foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked 
hands have crucified and slaine Whom God hath 
raised up, having loosed the pains of death; because 
it was not possible that He should be holden of it. 
For David speaketh concerning Him, being a pro- 
phet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath 
to him that of the fruit of his loins He would raise 
up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before 
spake of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul 
was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see cor- 
ruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof 
we all are witnesses.

ASCENSION DAY 91 


: NOW when Jesus was risen early the first day of 
the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out 
of whom He had cast seven devils. And she went 
and told them that had been with Him, as 
they mourned and wept. And they, when they heard 
that He was alive, and had been seen of her, believed 
not. After that He appeared in another form unto 

-two of them, as they walked, and went into the 
country. And they went and told it unto the resi- 
due: neither believed they them. Afterward He 
appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and 
upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of 
heart, because they believed not them which had seen 
Him after He was risen. And He said unto them: 
Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to 
every creature.

and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And 
while they looked steadfastly toward heaven, as He 
went up, behold, two men stood by them in white 
apparel; which also said: Ye men of Galilee, why

while He blessed them, He was parted from them, 
and carried up into heaven. And they worshipped 
Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and 
were continually in the temple, praising and bless- 
ing God. Amen.

The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the second chapter of the Acts of the 
Apostles, beginning at the first verse. 


WHEN the day of Pentecost was fully come, they 
were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly 
there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing 
mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they 
were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven 
tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of 
them; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, 
and began to speak with other tongues, as the 
Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling 
at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation 
under heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, 
the multitude came together, and were confound- 
ed, because that every man heard them speak in his 
own language. And they were all amazed, and mar- 
velled, saying one to another: Behold, are not all 
these which speak Galileans? And how hear we ev- 
ery man in our own tongue wherein we were born ? 
Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwell- 
"ers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea and Cappadocia, 
in Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in 
Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and

JESUS said unto His disciples: I will pray the 
Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, 
that He may abide with you for ever; even the 
Spirit of Truth, Whom the world cannot receive, be- 
cause it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him; but 
ye know Him; for He dwelleth with you, and shall 
be in you. I will not leave you comfortless; I will 
come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth 
Me no more; but ye see Me; because I live, ye shall 
live also. The Comforter, Which is the Holy Ghost, 
Whom the Father will send in My Name, He shall 
teach you all things, and bring all things to your 
remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace 
I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as 
the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your 
heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle

the Revelation of St. John the Divine, beginning at the 
second verse. 


IMMEDIATELY I was in the Spirit; and behold, 
a throne was set in heaven, and One sat on the 
throne. And He that sat was to look upon like a 
jasper and a sardine stone; and there was a rainbow 
round about the throne, in sight like unto an emer- 
ald. And round about the throne were four and 
twenty seats; and upon the seats I saw four and 
twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and 
they had on their heads crowns of gold. And out 
of the throne proceeded lightnings, and thunderings, 
and voices. And there were seven lamps of fire 
burning before the throne, which are the -seven 
Spirits of God. And before the throne there was a 
sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of 
the throne, and round about the throne, were four 
beasts full of eyes before and behind. And 
the first beast was like a lion, and _ the 
second beast like a calf; and the third beast 
had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like 
a flying eagle. And the four beasts had each of them 
six wings about him; and they were full of eyes with- 
in: and they rest not day and night, saying: Holy, 
holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, 
and is to come. And when those beasts give glory, 
and honour, and thanks, to Him that sat on the 
throne, Who liveth for ever and ever, the four and 
twenty elders fall down before Him that sat on 
the throne, and worship Him that liveth for ever and 
ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, 
_ and power; for Thou hast created all things, and for 
Thy pleasure they are and were created. 


Here endeth the Epistle.

Father are one; as the Father hath loved Me, so have 
I loved you; and this is My commandment, that ye

ing: Thiscup is the new testament in My Blood;

am the living’ Bread which came down from. heaven; 
if any man eat of this Bread, he shall live for ever; 
and the Bread that I will give is My Flesh, which 
I will give for the life of the world. The Jews there- 
fore strove among themselves, saying: How can this 
man give us his flesh to eat? Then Jesus said unto 
them: Amen, Amen, I say unto you: Except ye 
eat the. Flesh of the Son-of Man, and drink His 
Blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth My 
Flesh, and drinketh My Blood, hath eternal life; and 
I will raise him up at the last day. For My Flesh 
is meat indeed, and My Blood is drink indeed. He 
that eateth My Flesh and drinketh My Blood, dwell- 
eth in Me, and I in him. As the living Father hath 
sent Me, and I live by the Father: so he that 
eateth Me, even. he shall live by Me.. This is that 
Bread which came down from Heaven; not. as your 
fathers did eat manna, and are dead; he that eateth 
ofthis Bread shall live for ever,

His Son Jesus Christ. These things write we unto 
you that your joy may be full. This then is the 
message which we have heard of Him and declare 
unto you, that God is Light, and in Him is no dark-

Him and walk in darkness we lie, and do not the

come upon you; for he that walketh in darkness 
knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, 
believe in the light, that ye may be the children of 
light. He that believeth on Me, believeth not on Me 
only, but on Him that sent Me; and he that seeth 
‘Me, seeth Him that sent Me. I am come a light 
‘into the world, that whosoever believeth on Me 
‘should not abide in darkness.

“ AND the Angel said unto them: Bless God, praise 
Him and magnify Him, and: praise Him for the — 


things which He hath done unto you in: the sight of i 


all that live.’ It is good to praise God and exalt His 
Name, and honourably to show forth the works of 
God; therefore be not slack to praise Him. Do that 
which is good, and no evil shall touch you. A little 
with righteousness is better than much with un- 
righteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay 
up gold; for those. that exercise alms and righteous- 
ness ‘shall be filled with life, but they. that sin. are 
enemies to their own life. God hath sent me to heal 
thee and thy daughter, for I am Raphael, one of the 
seven holy Angels which present the prayers of the 
saints, and go in and os Lee the glory of the: 
Holy One. 


Then they were troubled and fell. upon their faces; 
for they feared. But the Angel said unto them: 
Fear not; it shall go well with you. Not of any fav- 
our of mine, ‘but of the will of our God I came; 
therefore praise Him for ever and give Him thanks, 
for I go up to Him that sent me. 


Then they confessed the great and wonderful 
works of God, and how the Angel of the Lord had 
appeared unto them; and they said: Blessed art Thou, 
O God, and blessed is Thy name for ever; and. bless- 
ed are all Thy holy Angels.

unto him an Angel of the Lord, standing on the right

but the Angel said unto him: Fear not, Zacharias;

of God; and I am sent to speak unto thee, and to

od is Love. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought 
Iso to love one another. No man hath seen God 
t any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth 

us, and His love is perfected in us. Hereby know 

that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He 
ath given us His Spirit. God is Love; and he that 
welleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. 
here is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out

fear; because fear hath torment. He that feareth 
is not made perfect in love. We love Him, because — 
He first loved us. If a man say: I love God, and hat- — 
eth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not — 
his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God, 
Whom he hath not seen? And this commandment 
have we from Him, that he who loveth God love his 
brother also.

I AM the true vine, and My Father is the Hus- 
bandman. I am the Vine, ye are the branches. Abide 
in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit 
of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can 
ye, except ye abide in Me. He that abideth in Me, 
and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; 
for without Me ye can do nothing. Herein is My 
Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall 
ye be My disciples. As the Father hath loved Me, 
so have I loved you; continue ye in My love. If ye 
keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; 
even as I have kept My Father’s commandments, 
and abide in His love. These things have I spoken 
unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and 
that your joy might be full. These things I com- 
mand you, that ye love one another.

only, use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but 
‘by love serve one another. For all the law is ful- 
filled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy 
ineighbour as thyself. This I say then: Walk in the 
‘Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh 
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spir- 
lit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one 
ito the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye 
\would. The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-

lance; against such there is no law. If we live in the

one to another in brotherly love, in honour preferring 
one another; not slothful in business; fervent’ in 
spirit, serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope, patient

you; bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that 
do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of 
the same mind one towards another. Mind not high 
things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be 
not wise in your own conceit. Recompense to no 
man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the 
sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as lieth

but every man also on the things of others. Let 
this mind be in you, which was also in Christ 
Jesus, Who, being in the form of God, made Himself 
of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a 
servant, and was made in the likeness of men, and 
became obedient unto death. Wherefore God hath 
highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is 
above every name, that at the Name of Jesus every 
knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in 
earth, and things under the earth, and that every 
tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to 
the glory of God the Father.

JESUS said:. The hour is come that the Son of 
Man should be glorified. Amen, Amen, I say unto 
you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground ana 
die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth 
much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and 
he that careth not for his life in this world shall 
keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve Me, let 
him follow Me; and where I am, there shall also 
My servant be. Father, glorify Thy Name. Then 
came there a voice from heaven saying: I have both 
glorified it, and will glorify it again.

shall break one of these least commandments, and 
shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in

Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? For whe- 
ther is easier, to say: Thy sins be forgiven thee, or 
to say: Arise and walk ? But that ye may know that 
the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive

all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace 
might, through the thanksgiving of many, redound

but though our outward man perish, yet the inward 
man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, 
which is but for 2 moment, worketh for us a far more

thou? And he answering said: Thou shalt love the 
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy 
soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy 
mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. Jesus said unto 
him: Thou hast answered right; this do and thou 
shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said 
unto Jesus: And who is my neighbour? And Jesus 
answering said: A certain man went down from 
Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves, which 
stripped him of his raiment and wounded him, and 
departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance 
there came down a certain priest that way; and when 
he saw him, he passed by on the other side. Like- 
wise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and 
looked on him, and passed by on the other side. But 
a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he 
was; when he saw him, he had compassion on him, and 
went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil 
and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought 
him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the 
morrow when he departed, he took out two pence 
and gave them to the host, and said unto him: Take 
care of him; and whatever thou spendest more, when 
I come again I will repay thee. Which now of these 
three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that 
fell among the thieves? And the lawyer said: He 
that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto 
him: Go, and do thou likewise.

that we can carry nothing out; so, having food and 
raiment, let us be therewith content. For they that 
will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into 
many foolish and hurtful lusts, ‘which drown men in 
destruction and perdition. For the love of money 
is the root of all evil, which some having coveted, 
they have erred from the faith and pierced them- 
selves through with many sorrows. But thou, O man 
of God, flee these things, and follow after righteous- 
ness, godliness, faith, love, patience,'meekness. Fight 
the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, 
whereunto thou art also called. I give thee charge in

phet ? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. 
For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I 
send My messenger before thy face, which shall pre- 
pare thy way before thee. Amen, I say unto you, 
among them that are born of women there hath not 
risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstand- 
ing, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is 
greater than he. And from the days of John the 
Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth

Unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I: might 
gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as 
under the law, that I might gain them that are un- 
der the law; to them that are without law, as with- 
out law (being not without law to God, but under 
the law to Christ), that I might gain them that are 
without law. To the weak became I as weak, that I 
might gain the weak; I am made all things to all men, 
that. I might by all means save some. And this I do 
for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof 
with you. Know ye not that they which run in a race 
run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye 
may obtain. And every man that striveth for the 
mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do-it to 
obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. 
I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not 
as one that beateth the air. But I keep under my

of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the 
twenty-eighth verse. 


COME unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy 
laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon 
you, and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in 
heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My 
yoke is easy and My burden is light. That it might be 
fulfilled which was spoken of Esaias the prophet, 
saying: Behold My servant, Whom I have chosen; 
My beloved, in Whom My soul is well pleased; I will 
put My Spirit upon Him, and He shall show judg- 
ment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, 
neither shall any man hear His voice in the street. 
A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax 
shall He not quench, till He send forth judgment unto 
victory; and in His Name shall the Gentiles trust.

LORD of all power and might, Who art the author 
and giver of all good things, may our hearts be so 
filled with gratitude to Thee that we may continually

MY brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the 
power of His might. Put on the whole armour of 
God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles 
of the adversary. For we wrestle not against flesh 
and blood, but against principalities, against powers, 
against the rulers of the darkness of this world, 
against spiritual wickedness in high places. Where- 
fore take unto you the whole armour of God, that 
ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and 
having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having 
your loins girt about with truth, and having on the 
breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shod with 
the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, 
taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able 
to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take 
the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, 
which is the word of God, watching thereunto with all 
perseverance. 

Here endeth the Epistle.

128 TWENTY-SECOND SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY 


WHEN. Jesus had called unto Him His twelve. dis- 
ciples, He gave them power over unclean spirits, to 
cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and 
all manner of disease. And He said unto them: Be- 
hold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; 
be -ye therefore ‘wise .as- serpents,. and. harmless .as 
doves. The disciple is not above his’ Master, nor the 
servant above his lord. .He that'.receiveth you re- 
ceiveth Me, and he that receiveth'Me receiveth Him 
that sent Me. Whosoever shall give to drink unto 
one of these little ones a cup of: cold water only in 
the name of a disciple, Amen I say unto you; he 
shall by no means lose his reward. He that loveth 
father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; 
and he that loveth son or daughter more than Me is 
not worthy of Me. And he that taketh not his cross 
and followeth after Me is not worthy of Me.. He 
that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his 
life for My sake shall find it.. But he that endureth 
to the end shall be saved.

that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, 
having no evil thing to say of you. For the grace of 
God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 
feaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly 
lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and godly 
in this present world, looking for that blessed hope, 
and the glorious appearing of the great God and 
our Saviour Jesus Christ; putting us in mind to be 
subject to principalities and powers, to obey magis- 
trates, to be ready to every good work, to speak 
evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing 
all meekness unto all men. This is a faithful say- 
ing, and these things I will that thou affirm constant- 
ly, that they which have believed in God might be 
eareful to maintain good works. ‘These things are 
good and profitable unto men.

I SAY unto you which hear: Love your enemies, 
do good to them which hate you, bless them that curse 
you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye 
also to them likewise. Love ye your enemies, and do 
‘good and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your 
reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children 
of the Highest, for He is kind unto the unthankful 
and to the evil. Be ye therefore merciful, as your 
Father is merciful. Judge not, and ye shall not be 
judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; 
forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. Give, and it shall 
be given unto you; good measure, pressed down and 
shaken together, and running over, shall men give 
into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye 
mete withal it shall be measured to you again.

130 TWENTY-THIRD SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY 


Che Gwenty-third Sunday after Crinity 
Intent: The Practice of What is Taught. 


The Collect 


ALMIGHTY God, the fountain of all wisdom, we 
pray Thee that the words which we hear this day 
with our outward ears may through Thy grace be so 
grafted inwardly in our hearts that they may bring 
forth in us the fruit of good living, to the honour 
and praise of Thy Name, through Christ our Lord. 


R. Amen. 
The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the first chapter of the 
General Epistle of St. James, beginning at the nine- 
teenth verse. 


MY beloved brethren, let every man be swift to 
hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of 
man worketh not the righteousness of God. Be ye 
doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your 
own selves. For if any man be a hearer of the word, 
and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his 
natural face in a glass; for he beholdeth himself, and 
goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what man- 
ner of man he was. But whoso looketh into the 
perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he 
being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, 
this man shall be blessed in his deed. Pure religion 
and undefiled before God and the Father is this: To 
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, 
and to keep himself unspyotted from the world. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 
The holy Gospel is taken from the sixth chapter of 
that according to St. John, beginning at the twenty- 
eighth verse. 
THEN said they unto Jesus: What shall we do, 
that we might work the works of God ? Jesus answer- 
ed and said unto them: This is the work of God, 


TWENTY-FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY 131 





that ye believe on Him Whom He hath sent. For 
the Bread of God is He Which cometh down from 
heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Then said 
they unto Him: tLord, evermore give us this bread. 
And Jesus said unto them: I am the Bread of Life; 
he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he 
that believeth on Me shall never thirst. All that the 
Father giveth Me shall come to Me; and him that 
cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out. For this 
is the Father’s will which hath sent Me, that of all 
which He hath given Me I should lose nothing, but 
should raise it up again at the last day. It is the 
spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing; 
the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and 
they are life.

The Collect 


O LORD of Light unquenchable, grant unto Thy

Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians, be- 
ginning at the fourteenth verse. 


FOR this cause I bow my knees unto the Father 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, of Whom the whole family 
in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant 
you, according to the riches of His glory, to be 
strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner 
man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; 
that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be 
able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth,

love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye — 
might be filled with all the fullness of God. Now 
unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly 
above all that we ask or think, according to the 
power that worketh in us, unto Him be glory in the 
Church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world 
without end. Amen. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the seventh chapter 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the six- 
teenth verse. 


JESUS said: My doctrine is not Mine, but His 
that sent Me. If any man will do His will, he shall 
know of the doctrine whether it be of God. Judge 
not according to the appearance, but judge righteous 
judgment. If any man thirst, let him come unto Me 
and drink. I am the light of the world; he that fol- 
loweth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have 
the light of life. If ye continue in My word, then 
are ye My disciples indeed; and ye shall know the 
truth, and the truth shall make you free.

darkness of ignorance, and guide them to Thee, Who, 
with the Father and the Son, art worshipped and 
glorified for ever. R. Amen.

The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the seventh chapter of the Book of 
the Prophet Daniel, beginning at the ninth verse. 





DANIEL said: I saw in my vision by night, and 
the Ancient of Days did sit, Whose garment was 
white as snow, and the hair of His head like the 
pure wool; His throne was like the fiery flame, and 
His wheels as burning fire. A. fiery stream issued 
and came forth from before Him; thousand thou- 
sands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times 
ten thousand stood before Him. And behold, one 
like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, 
and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought 
Him near before Him. And there was given Him 
dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all people, 
nations and languages should serve Him; His do- 
minion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not 
pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be 
destroyed. The saints of the most High also shall 
take the kingdom, and possess it for ever and ever. 
And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great 
‘Prince which standeth for the children of Thy people; 
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness 
of the firmament; but they that turn many to right- 
eousness as the stars for ever and ever. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the eighth chapter 
of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the fourth 
verse. 


WHEN much people were gathered together Jesus 
spake unto them by a parable: A sower went out 
to sow his seed; and as he sowed some fell by the 
wayside, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of 
the air devoured it. And some fell upon a rock; and 
as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, be- 
cause it lacked moisture. And some fell among thorns; 


134 THE BAPTISM OF OUR LORD 


and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. 
And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and - 
bare fruit an hundredfold. He that hath ears to 
hear, let him hear. And His disciples asked Him: 
What might this parable be? And He said: Unto 
you it is given to know the mysteries of the king- 
dom of God; but to others in parables; that seeing 
they might not see, and hearing, they might not 
understand. The parable is this: The seed 
is the word of God.° Those by the wayside are they 
that hear; then cometh the adversary, and taketh away 
the word out of their hearts, lest they should under- 
stand and be saved. They on the rock are they who, 
when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these 
have no root, which for a while believe, and in time 
of temptation fall away. And that which fell among 
thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go 
forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleas- 
ures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. 
But that on the good ground are they which in an 
honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep 
it, and bring forth fruit with patience. 


If there be more than twenty-five Sundays after 
Trinity, the service of some of those Sundays that were 
omitted after the Epiphany shall be used to supply as 
many as are wanting. And if there be fewer than 
twenty-five Sundays, those that remain over may be 
omitted, provided that this last Collect, Epistle and 


Gospel shall always be used upon the Sunday next before j 
Advent. ;

The Collect 
O LORD, Who didst deign as at this time to receive 
the baptism of water at the hands of Thy Fore- 
runner, grant that we may become worthy to receive 
at Thy Hands the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of 
Fire, Thou Who art the Way, the Truth and the 
Life, to Whom be praise for evermore. B. Amen. 


: THE BAPTISM OF OUR LORD 135 


The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the eleventh chapter of the Book of 
the Prophet Isaiah, beginning at the first verse. 


THERE shall come forth a Rod out of the stem 
of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots; 
and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, the 
Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of 
counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of 
reverence to the Lord. He shall not judge after the 
sight of His eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of 
His ears; but with righteousness shall He judge the 
poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the 
earth; and righteousness shall be the girdle of Hig 
loins, and faithfulness tne girdle of His reins. They 
shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain; 
for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the 
Lord, as the waters cover the sea. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the third chapter 
of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the 
first verse. 


IN those days came John the Baptist, preaching 
in the wilderness of Judea, and saying: Repent ye, 
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. I indeed 
baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that 
cometh after me is mightier than I, Whose shoes I 
am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with 
the Holy Ghost and with Fire. Then cometh Jesus 
from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized 
of Him. But John forbad Him, saying: I have 
need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to 
me? And Jesus said unto him: Suffer it to be so 
now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteous- 
ness. Then he suffered Him. And Jesus, when He 
was baptized, went up straightway out of the water; 
and, lo, the heavens were opened unto Him, and He

be praise and adoration for evermore. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the first chapter of the 
Second Epistle General of St. Peter, beginning at 
the sixteenth verse. 


We have not followed cunningly devised fables 
when we made known unto you the power and com- 
ing of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses — 
of His majesty. For He received from God the Father 
honour and glory, when there came such a voice to 
Him from the excellent glory: This is My beloved 
Son, in Whom I am well pleased. And this voice 
which came from heaven we heard, when we were 
with Him in the holy mount. We have also a more 
‘sure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that 
ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a 
dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star 
arise in your hearts. 


Here endeth the Epistle.

JESUS taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, 
and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart, 
and was transfigured before them; and His face did 
shine as the sun, and His raiment was white as the 
light. And behold, there appeared unto them Moses 
and Elias talking with Him. ‘Then said Peter unto 
Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here; if Thou 
wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for Thee, 
and one for Moses, and one for Elias. While he yet 
spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and 
behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said: This 
is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased; hear 
ye Him. And when the disciples heard it, they fell 
on their faces, and were sore afraid. But Jesus came 
and touched them, and said: Arise, and be not 
afraid. And when they had lifted up their eyes, 
they saw no man save Jesus only. 


The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for 
seven days after, except on the Festival of the Presen- 
tation of our Lord in the Temple, when the Collect 
alone shall be said after that of the Day.

during the Celebration, should be placed another of 
violet. 


138 THE PRESENTATION OF OUR LORD 





The clergy and celebrant in violet vestments and 
the acolytes enter the chancel by the short way and 
take their usual places. The ceremony of the Asperges © 
is then performed. When this ts finished the Priest, 
taking the aspergill, sprinkles the candles which lie upon 
a credence table. He now exorcizes and blesses the 
candles, saying: 


Let these candles be + purified and + blessed by 
Him in Whose honour they shall be burned. 


The Priest blesses some incense, the candles are now — 
censed and afterwards distributed by the Priest to the 
clergy, acolytes and choir. The clergy then group them- 
selves before the Altar and the Priest says: 


Blessed Lord, Who art the Light of the world, 
grant that as on this day we do receive Thee with 
glory in Thine earthly Temple, so may the Light of 
Thy holy Presence ever burn brightly in the Temple 
of our hearts. R. Amen. 


The Priest now turns to the people and, momentarily 
extending his hands, says: 


Let us go forth in peace. 
People. In the Name of the Lord. 


The Procession 


The procession starts and moves through the body of 
the church singing a hymn and passes out into the ves- 
tibule. Here the candles are lighted, and the violet vest- 
ments changed to white. The Priest, wearing a hum- 
eral vetl, takes the monstrance containing the Host 
(which has been taken beforehand to the vestibule, and 
there guarded by a cleric), and the procession enters 
the church singing another hymn. Upon reaching the 
chancel the Altar is dressed, and the violet Altar frontal 
removed, leaving the white in its place; the monstrance 
is then placed on its throne. After the celebrant is 
properly vested the Eucharist begins as usual; it is 
celebrated before the Exposed Sacrament.

with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set 
thine heart upon all that I shall show thee; for to 
the intent that I might show them unto thee art thou 
brought hither. And he brought me to the gate of 
the Temple, the gate that looketh toward the east. 
And behold, the glory of God came from the way of 
the east; and His Voice was like the voice of many 
waters, and the earth shone with His glory; and I 
fell upon my face. And the glory of the Lord came 
into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect 
is toward the east. So the Spirit took me up and 
brought me into the inner court; and behold, the 
glory of the Lord filled the whole house, and I heard 
Him speaking unto. me. And He said unto me: Son 
of man, the place of My throne shall be holy, where 
I will dwell in the midst of My children for ever; 
the whole limit thereof round about shall be most 
holy; behold, this is the law of the house. And again 
I fell upon my face before the glory of the Lord.

AND when the days of her purification according

Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord. And 
behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name 
was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, 
waiting fer the consolation of Israel; and the Holy 
Ghost was upon him. And it was revealed unto him 
by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before 
he had seen the Lord’s Christ. And he came by the 
Spirit into the Temple; and when the parents brought 
in the child Jesus, to do for Him after the custom of 
the law, then took he Him up in his arms, and blessed 
God, and said: Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant 
depart in peace, according to Thy word; for mine 
eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast pre- 
pared before the face of all people, to be a light to 
lighten the Gentiles, and to be the glory of Thy 
people Israel. And Joseph and His mother marvelled 
at those things which were spoken of Him.

THE Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because 
the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto 
the meek. He hath sent me to bind up the broken- 
hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the 
opening of the prison to them that are bound; to 
proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and to com- 
fort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn 
to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy 
for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of 
heaviness; that they might be called trees of right- 
eousness, the planting of the Lord, that He might be 
glorified. And ye shall be named the priests of the 
Lord; men shall call you the ministers of our God. 
Behold, I will greatly rejoice in the Lord; I shall be 
joyful in my God; for He hath clothed me with the 
garments of salvation. He hath covered me with the 
robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh him- 
self with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself 
with her jewels. For as the earth bringeth forth her 
bud and as the garden causeth the things that are 
sown in it to spring forth, so the nord God will cause 
righteousness and praise to spring forth before all 
the nations.

AND in the sixth month the Angel Gabriel was sent 
from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to 
a Virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, 
of the house of David; and the Virgin’s name was 
Mary. And the Angel came in unto her, and said: 
Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with 
thee; blessed art thou among women. And when she 
saw him she was troubled at his saying, and cast in 
her mind what manner of salutation this should be. 
And the Angeli said unto her: Fear not, Mary; for 
thou hast found favour with God. And behold, thou 
shalt bring forth a Son, and shalt call His name 
Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son 
of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him 
the throne of His father David. And He shall reign 
over the house of Jacob for ever; and of His kingdom 
there shall be no end. The Holy Ghost shall come 
upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall over- 
shadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which 
shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. 
And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; 
be it unto me according to thy word.

The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the third chapter of the Book of the 
Wisdom of Solomon, beginning at the first verse. 


IHE souls of the righteous are in the hand of 
God, and there shall no torment touch them. In the 
sight of the unwise they seemed to die, and their de- 
parture is taken for misery, and their going from 
us to be utter destruction; but they are in peace. 
For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet 
is their hope full of immortality. And having been 
a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded; 
for God proved them, and found them worthy for 
Himself. As gold in the furnace hath He tried them, 
and received them as a burnt offering. They shall 
judge the nations, and have dominion over the peo- 
ple, and their Lord shall reign for ever. They that put 
their trust in Him shall understand the truth, and 
such as be faithful in love shall abide with Him; for 
grace and mercy is to His saints, and He hath care 
for His elect. 

Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the sixteenth chapter 
of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the 
twenty-fourth verse. 


THEN said Jesus unto His disciples: If any man 
will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take 
up his cross, and follow Me. For whosoever will save 
his life shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life 
for My sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, 
if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own 
soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his 
soul? For the Son of Man shall come in the glory 
of His Father with His Angels; and then He shall 
reward every man according to his works.

We thank Thee, O most mighty Lord, for this great 
Empire which Thy hands have builded; may we who 
love it labour to uphold its honour by nobility of life,

good, that peace and brotherhood may reign through- 
out the world; through Christ our Holy Lord. R. 


Amen, 
The Epistle 


The Epistle is taken from the twelfth chapter of 
the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Cor- 
inthians, beginning at the twelfth verse. 

As the body is one and hath many members, and all 
the members of that body, being many, are one body; 
so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we are all bap- 
tized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, 
whether we be bond or free, and-have been all made 
to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not one 
member, but many; and the eye cannot say unto the 
hand: I have no need of thee; nor again the head to 
the feet; I have no need of you, There should be no 
schism in the body, but the members should have the 
same care one for another. And where one member 
suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member 
be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. Now 
ye are the body of Christ and members in particular. 


Here endeth the Epistle.

forefather Abraham, that He would give us that we, 
being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might 
serve Him without fear in holiness and righteousness 
before Him, all the days of our life. And thou, child, 
shalt be called the prophet of the Highest, for thou 
shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare His 
ways; to give knowledge of salvation unto His people 
for the remission of their sins, through the tender 
mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring from on 
high hath visited us, to give light to them that sit in 
darkness and in the shadow of death, and to guide 
our feet into the way of peace.

Prophet Isaiah, beginning at the third verse. 


THE voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: 
Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the 
desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall 
be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made 
low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and 
the rough places plain. And the glory of the Lord 
_ shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: 
for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. The 
grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of 
our God shall stand for ever. Behold, the Lord God 
will come with strong hand, and His arm: shall rule 
for Him: behold, His reward is with Him, and His

whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited us;

PETER therefore was kept in prison; but prayer 
was made without ceasing of the Church unto God 
for him. The same night Peter was sleeping between 
two soldiers, bound with two chains; and the keepers 
before the. door kept the prison. And behold, the 
Angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined 


ST. PETER AND THE HOLY APOSTLES 149 


in the prison; and he smote Peter on the side, and 
raised him up, saying: Arise up quickly. And his 
chains fell off from his hands. And the Angel said 
unto him; Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals; and 
so he did. And he saith unto him: Cast thy gar- 
ment about thee, and follow me. And he went out 
and followed him, and wist not that it was true which 
was done by the Angel, but thought he saw a vision. 
When they were past the first and the second ward, 
they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the 
city, which opened to them of his own accord; and 
they went out, and passed on through one street, and 
forthwith the Angel departed from him. And when 
Peter was come to himself, he said: Now I know of 
a surety that the Lord hath sent His Angel, and 
hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from 
all the expectation of the people of the Jews. 
Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel

men say that I, the son of Man, am? And they said: 
Some say that Thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, 
and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He 
saith unto them: But whom say ye that I am? And 
Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art Christ, 
the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and 
said unto him: Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; 
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, 
but My Father Which is in heaven. And I say also unto 
thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build My Church;*and the gates of hell shall not 
prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the 
keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou 
shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and 
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed 
in heaven.

the hosts of heaven; grant that we, Thy people, may 
so follow that her most noble example, that we may

The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle

Wisdom of Solomon, beginning at the first verse. 


O GOD of my fathers, Who hast made all things 
with Thy word, give me wisdom, that sitteth by Thy 
throne, and reject me not from among Thy children. 
For though a man be never so perfect among the 
children of men, yet if Thy wisdom be not with him, 
he shall be nothing regarded. For wisdom was with 
Thee, which knoweth Thy works, and was present 
when Thou madest the world, and knew what was 
acceptable in Thy sight, and right in Thy command- 
ments. O send her out of Thy holy heavens, and 
from the throne of Thy glory, that being present, she 
may labour with me, that I may know what is pleas-. 
ing unto Thee. For she knoweth and understandeth 
all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my do- 
ings, and preserve me in her power; so shall my works 
be acceptable. For who can think what the will of 
the Lord is, and Thy counsel who hath known, except 
Thou give wisdom, and send Thy Holy Spirit from 
above ? So the ways of them which lived on the 
earth were reformed, and men were taught the things 
that are pleasing unto Thee, and were saved through 
wisdom. 

Here endeth the Epistle. 


THE NATIVITY OF OUR LADY 151 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the first chapter of 
that according to St. Luke, beginning at the twenty- 
sixth verse. 


AND in the sixth month the Angel Gabriel was 
sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 
to a Virgin espoused to a man whose name was 
Joseph, of the house of David; and the Virgin’s name 
was Mary. And the Angel came in unto her, and 
said: Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord 
is with thee; blessed art thou among women. And 
when she saw him she was troubled at his saying,

should be. And the Angel said unto her: Fear not, 
Mary; for thou hast found favour with God. And be- 
hold, thou shalt bring forth a Son, and shalt call His 
name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called 
the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give 
unto Him the throne of His father David. And He 
shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of 
His kingdom there shall be no end. The Holy Ghost 
shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest 
shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing 
which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son 
of God. And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of 
the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. 


The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for

Che Natinity of Our Lady 


The Collect 


WE thank Thee, O God, for that most sweet and 
laudable pattern set before us by the holy Lady 
Mary, mother of Jesus, whom Thy holy Church hath 
ever held up unto her people as a bright ensample of 
purity and godly life; and we pray that on this the

Festival of her Nativity there may shine forth with- 
in us the light of ever-growing purity: and holiness, 
through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the eighth chapter of the Book of the 
Wisdom of Solomon, beginning at the first verse. 


WISDOM reacheth from one end of the world to 
the other; mightily and sweetly doth she order all 
things. In that she is conversant with God, she 
hath magnified her nobility; yea, the Lord of all 
things Himself loved her. Fer she is privy to the 
mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of 
His works. If riches be a possession to be desired 
in this life, what is richer than wisdom, that worketh 
all things ? And if prudence work, who of all that 
are is a more cunning worker than she ? If a man 
love righteousness, her labours are virtues; for she 
teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and forti- 
tude, than which men can have nothing more profit- 
able in their life. By means of her I shall obtain 
immortality, for she is the mother of fair love, and 
of patience and perseverance, and of holy hope. Thou 
shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put 
her about thee as a crown of joy. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the first chapter of 
that according to St. Luke, beginning at the thirty-

MARY arose in those days, and went into the hill 
country, into a city of Juda, and entered into the 
house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth. And it 
came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation 
of Mary, she was filled with the Holy Ghost, and she 


ST. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS 153 





spake out with a loud voice, and said: Blessed art 
thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy 
womb. Whence is this to me, that the mother of my 
Lord should come to me? For lo! as soon as the voice 
of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe 
leaped in my womb for joy. Blessed is she that be- 
lieveth; for there shall be a performance of those 
things which were told her from the Lord. And 
Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my 
spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For He hath 
regarded the lowliness of His handmaiden; for behold 
from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. 
For He that is mighty hath magnified me; and holy 
is His Name. 


St. Michael and all Angels 


The Collect 


ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, with all our 
hearts we praise Thee for the great glory of Thy 
most holy Angels; we thank Thee for their wonderful 
wisdom, their supreme strength, their radiant beauty; 
and, as their resistless power is used always and 
utterly in Thy service, so may we, following zealous- 
ly their resplendent example, devote ourselves wholly 
to the helping of our brethren, through Christ our 
Lord. R. Amen. 


The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the seventh and eighth chapters of the 
Revelation of St. John the Divine. 


I SAW the seven Angels which stood before God; 
and to them were given seven trumpets. And an- 
other Angel came and stood at the Altar, having a 
golden censer; and there was given unto him much 
incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all 
saints upon the golden Altar which was brought be- 


154 ST. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS 





fore the throne. And the smoke of the incense, which 
came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up 
before God out of the Angel’s hand. 


And all the Angels stood round about the throne, 
and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell 
before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, 
saying: Amen; blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and 
thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be 
unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the eighteenth chapter 
of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the 
first verse. 


THEN came the disciples unto Jesus, saying: Who 
is the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven? And 
Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in 
the midst of them, and said: Amen, I say unto you,’ 
except ye be converted, and become as little children, 
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Who- 
soever therefore shall humble himself as this little 
child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
And whoso shall receive one such little child in My 
Name receiveth Me. But whoso shall offend one of 
these little ones which believe in Me, it were better 
for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, 
and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 
Woe unto the world because of offences; for it must 
needs be that offences come, but woe to that man 
by whom the offence cometh. Take heed that ye 
despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto 
you, that in heaven their Angels do always behold 
the face of My Father which is in heaven.

for sia days after, but on the seventh day those of the 
Third Sunday after Trinity shall be used.

The Epistle 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the seventh chapter of the Revelation 
of St. John the Divine, beginning at the ninth verse. 


I BEHELD, and lo, a great multitude, which no 
man could number, of all nations and kindreds, and 
people, and tongues, stood before the throne and be- 
fore the Lamb, clothed with white robes and palms in 
their hands, and cried with a loud voice, saying: 
Salvation to our God Which sitteth upon the throne, 
and unto the Lamb. And all the Angels stood round 
about the throne, and about the elders and the four 
beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, 
and worshipped God, saying: Amen. Blessing, and 
glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, 
and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and 
ever, Amen, And one of the elders .said un- 
to me: what are these which are arrayed in 
white robes, and whence came they? These are they 
which came out of great tribulation, and have wash- 
ed their robes, and made them white. Therefore are 
they before the throne of God, and serve Him day 
and night in His Temple; and He that sitteth on the 
throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger 
no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun 
light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which 
is in the midst of thé throne shall feed them, and

and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. 
Here endeth the Epistle.

THEN shall the King say unto them on His right 
hand: Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the 
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of 
the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave Me 
meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink, I was a 
Stranger and ye took Me in, naked and ye clothed 
Me, I was sick and ye visited Me, I was in prison 
and ye came unto Me. Then shall the righteous 
answer Him saying: Lord, when saw we Thee an 
hungred, and fed Thee, or thirsty and gave Thee 
drink ? When saw we Thee a stranger and took Thee 
in, or naked and clothed Thee? Or when saw we 
Thee sick, or in prison, and came unto Thee? And 
the King shall answer and say unto them: Amen, I 
say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one 
of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it 
unto Me. 


The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for 
seven days after, except on the Holy Day of All Souls,

not, even as others which have no hope. For if we

but is passed from death unto life. Amen, Amen, I 
say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when 
the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and 
they that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life 
in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life 
in Himself, and hath given Him authority to exe- 
cute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man. 
Marvel not at this; they that have done good shall 
come unto the resurrection of life; and they that have 
done evil unto the resurrection of judgment.

I called upon the Lord; He delivered me from my 
strong enemy, and from them that hated me. The 
Lord was my stay, and He brought me forth also into 
a large place. Thou art my lamp, O Lord; the Lord 
will lighten my darkness. His way is perfect; the 
word of the Lord is tried; He is a buckler to all that 
trust in Him; He is my strength and my power. Thou, 
O Lord, hast given me the shield of Thy salvation,

160 COMMON OF SAINTS 





BEHOLD My servant whom I uphold; Mine elect, 
in whom My soul delighteth; I have put My Spirit 
upon him, and he shall bring forth judgment to My 
people. A bruised reed shall he not break, and the 
smoking flax shall he not quench; he shall bring forth 
judgment unto truth. He shail not fail nor be dis- 
couraged, till he have set judgment in the earth, and 
the isles shall wait for his law. I the Lord have call- 
ed thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, 
and will keep thee, and give thee for a light of the 
Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, to bring cut the 
prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in dark- 
ness out of the prison-house. I will lead them in 
paths that they have not known; I will make dark- 
ness light before them, and crooked things straight. 
These things will I do unto them, and not forsake 
them. 

Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the fifth chapter of 
that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the 
second verse. 


JESUS taught His disciples, saying: Blessed are 
the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be com- 
forted. Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit 
the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and 
thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled. 
Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy. 
Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see 
God. Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be 
called the children of God. Blessed are they which are 
persecuted for righteousness’ sake; for theirs is the 
kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall 
revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all man- 
ner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, 
and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in 
heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets which 
were before you. ;
