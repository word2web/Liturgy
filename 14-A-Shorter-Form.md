to his left and to his right, he continues: 

In the strength of the Lord do I repel all evil from 
this His holy Altar and sanctuary, : 

Turning to the people and sprinkling them with the 
same triple motion: 
and from this House, wherein we worship Him: 

Turning back to the Altar and resigning the asper-

of God; , 

2. And are built upon the foundation of the apostles 
and prophets: Jesus Christ Himself being the chief 
-corner-stone. : 

_ 3. In Whom all the building fitly framed together: 
groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord;

this seal: let everyone that nameth the Name of 
Christ depart from iniquity.

ing collected, and during that hymn the Priest censes the 
oblations and the Altar in due and ancient form. When

fore the centre of the Altar, saying: 


As this incense rises before Thee, O Lord, so let 
our prayer be set forth in Thy sight. Let Thy holy 
Angels encompass Thy people and breathe forth upon 
them the spirit of Thy blessing. 


As he returns the censer to the thurifer or deacon, he 
says: 


May the Lord enkindle within us the fire of His 
love and the flame of everlasting charity. 


He is himself censed, as are afterwards the chow 
and people, who stand for this ceremony, bowing before 
and after. The Priest dips his fingers into a bowl 
of water, wipes them, and says, turning towards the 
people: 

ORATE FRATRES 


Brethren, we have built a Temple for the distri- 
bution of Christ’s power; let us now prepare a chan- 
nel for its reception; and to that end pray ye that 
my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the 
Father Almighty. | 

C. May the Lord receive the sacrifice at thy hands, 
and sanctify our lives in His service. 

P. Let us pray. 

We lay before Thee, O Lord, these Thy creatures 


of bread and wine, + linking them spiritually with 
ourselves, and praying Thee to receive through them

offer and present unto Thee ourselves, our souls and 
bodies, to be a holy and continual sacrifice unto Thee.

‘that we should at all times and in all places give 
‘thanks unto Thee, O Lord, holy Father, Almighty 
| everlasting God. (Here follows the proper Preface, if 
| any.) Therefore, with Angels and Archangels, with 
| Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers, with 
Cherubim and Seraphim, and with all the company of

| earth are full of ane glory; Glory be to Thee, O Lord 
| most high.

| THE PRAYER OF CONSECRATION 


The Priest continues: 


O Lord, these our oblations have served as tokens 
and channels of our love and devotion towards Thee; 





200 SHORTER FORM HOLY EUCHARIST 


but now we + break the link with us and with all 
lower things, and we pray Thee to + purify and to +. 
hallow them as earthly channels of Thy wondrous 
power. We desire to offer this holy Sacrifice espec- 
ially for Thy holy catholic Church, for George our 
King, N. our Presiding Bishop, N. our Bishop, for 
all our Bishops, clergy, and faithful, for those here 
present, and for all who in this transitory life are in 
trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other adversity 
(especially .. .). Likewise do we offer it for all 
those Thy children whom it hath pleased Thee to de- 
liver from the burden of the flesh (especially for .. .), 
that, freed from earthly toil and care, they may enjoy 
the felicity of Thy Presence, evermore praising Thee 
in word and deed, O God, everlasting, living, and true. 

With his hands spread over the offerings, he continues; 

Wherefore, O holy Lord, Father Almighty, we pray 
Thee to look down on and accept as a channel these 
offerings, and with Thy Holy Spirit and Word to + 
bless, + approve, and + ratify them that they may 
become for us His most precious + Body and + Blood. 

Who the day before He suffered took bread into His 
holy and venerable hands, and with His eyes lifted up 
to heaven unto Thee, God, His Almighty Father, giving 
thanks to Thee, He + blessed, brake, and gave it 
to His disciples, saying: Take and eat ye all of this, 
for 

THIS IS MY BODY. 

In like manner, after He had supped, taking also 
this noble chalice into His holy and venerable hands, 
again giving thanks to Thee, He + blessed it and 
gave it to His disciples, saying: Take and drink ye 
all of this, for 


THIS IS MY BLOOD. 


As oft as ye shall do these things, ye shall do 
them in remembrance of Me. 


After some moments of silent adoration, the follow- 


ing verse shall be sung very softly, all devoutly kneel- 
ing: 











SHORTER FORM HOLY EUCHARIST 201 


_ Thee we adore, O hidden Splendour, Thee, 
Who in Thy Sacrament dost deign to be; 
We worship Thee beneath this earthly veil, 
And here Thy presence we devoutly hail. 


After a short pause all stand and sing the Adeste 
Fideles, as under: 


O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, 

O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem. 

Come and behold Him, Monarch of the Angels; 

O come, let us adore Him; O come, let us adore Him; 
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord. 


| Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, throned on Thine Altar, 


Ever to Thee be highest glory given. 
Word of the Father, Splendour everlasting ; 
O come, let us adore Him, ete. Amen. 


The people again kneel. 


P. Wherefore, O Lord and heavenly Father, we Thy 
humble servants do offer unto Thee,this, the most 
precious gift which Thou hast bestowed upon us, in 


| token of our + love, and of the perfect + devotion 


and + sacrifice of our + minds and + hearts to Thee; 
and we pray that Thou wouldst command Thy holy 
Angel to bear our oblation to Thine Altar on high, 
there to be offered by Him Who, as the eternal High 
Priest, for ever offers Himself as the eternal Sacri- 
fice. 


And we do pray for Thy servant who ministers at 


| this Altar, that, meetly celebrating the mysteries of 
| the most holy + Body and + Blood of Thy Son, 





he may be + filled with Thy mighty power and bless- 


ing. 
He makes this last cross upon himself. 


Likewise we pray Thee to sanctify Thy people here 
present with these Thy heavenly gifts, and through 
these mysteries do Thou + hallow, + quicken, and + 
bless them, that both in their hearts and in their 
lives they may show forth Thy praise and glorify Thy 


holy Name. 


202 SHORTER FORM HOLY EUCHARIST 5; 


He makes with the Host the sign of the cross three 


times over the Chalice. 


All these things do we ask, O Father, in the Name 
and through the mediation of Thy most blessed Son, 
for we acknowledge and confess with our hearts and 
lips that + by Him were all things made, yea, all 
things both in heaven and earth; + with Him as the 
indwelling Life do all things exist, and + in Him as 
the transcendent Glory all things live and move and 
have their being: 


Then horizontally twice between the Chalice and his 
breast. 


To Whom with Thee, O mighty + Father, in the

and glory, throughout the ages of ages. BR. Amen, 


The Priest here holds the Host directly over the 
Chalice, and raises both to the level of his eyes. 


THE COMMEMORATION OF THE SAINTS 
The Priest crosses himself with the paten. 


We praise and thank Thee, holy Lord, for the glory 
of Thy Saints, and we + join with them in worship 
before Thy great white throne, whence flow all love 


and light and blessing through all the worlds which 


Thou hast made. 


O Son of God, Who showest Thyself this day upon |

The peace of the Lord be always with you. 

Cc. And with thy spirit. 


P. O Thou Who in this adorable Sacrament hast 
left us a living memorial and pledge of Thy marvel- 
| lous love for mankind, and dost therein graciously 
draw us into wondrous and mystic communion with 
| Thee, grant us so to receive the sacred mysteries of 
Thy Body and Blood that our souls may be lifted into 
the immensity of Thy love, and that, being filled 
with a high endeavour, we may ever be mindful of 
Thine indwelling Presence and breathe forth the frag- 
rance of a holy life. R. Amen.

| The Priest communicates in both kinds, and admin- 
| 





isters to the clergy and choir as usual. He blesses the 
people with a Particle as he says: 

+ Ye that desire to partake of the Body of the 
Lord, draw nigh and receive this most holy Sacra- 
ment. 

As he administers the communion to each, the Priest 
says: 

The Body of our Lord Christ keep thee unto 
life eternal. 

When all who wish have communicated, he performs 
the ablutions in the usual form, and says: 


Under the veil of earthly things now have we com- 
munion with our Lord Jesus Christ; soon with open 
face shall we behold Him, and, rejoicing in His glory, 
be made like unto Him. Then shall His true disciples 
be brought by Him with exceeding joy pefore the pres-
