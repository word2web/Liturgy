THE CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 





At the conclusion of the Asperges the Consecrator 
takes his seat upon the faldstool, the assistant Bishops 
and Bishop Elect rise, and, taking the hand of the lat- 
ter, the senior assistant Bishop addresses the Consecrator 
in these words: 

Most Reverend Father, our holy Mother the Church 
catholic prays that you would raise this Priest here 
present to the charge of the Episcopate. 


Consecrator. Knowest thou him to be worthy ? 


S.4.B. As far as human frailty allows me to judge, 
I do both know and attest that he is worthy of the 
charge of this office. 


Con. Thanks be to God. 


The Consecrator continues: Have you the protocol 
of election 7 

S.A.B. We have. 

Con. Let it be read. 

All sit and the protocol is read. This being done the 
Bishop Elect kneels before the faldstool, puts his hands 
together between those of the Consecrator, and says: 


Bishop Elect. In the Name of the Father, and of 
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen. I, N., chosen 
Bishop of the Church, do promise all due reverence 
and obedience in matters canonical to the Presiding 
Bishop and to his successors, So help me God, 
through Christ our Lord. 

The Consecrator pressing his hands lightly says: 

The peace of the Lord be always with thee. 

B-H, Amen. 


Con. The order established of old by the 
Fathers teaches and commands that whoso is elected 
to the Episcopal Order shall be beforehand diligent- 
ly examined in all charity concerning the doctrine of 


350 CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 





the Holy Trinity, and the divers relations and vir- 
tues suitable to this charge; and it is seemly that 
this practice be maintained. For since we verily 
believe that this stewardship has been committed 
unto us by Christ Himself, it behoves us to assure 
ourselves that they to whom we in turn commit it 
shall know, and in their hearts be fully persuaded, 
how great is their responsibility before Him. In 
His Name, therefore, and in virtue of this authority 
and commandment, we now ask of thee, well-beloved 
brother, in sincere charity, whether if thou be or- 
dained to this sacred charge, thou wilt exercise its 
powers wholly for what seemeth unto thee the true 
benefit of Christ’s holy catholic Church, and for no 
other purpose whatsoever, laying aside utterly all 
thought of personal predilection or advancement. 


B.E, With my whole heart I will en- 
deavour so to do. 


Con. Wilt thou, so far as in thee lies, set thy 
affection on things above and not on things of 
earth ? 


B.E. TI will. 


Con. Wilt thou with God’s help ever remember — 
that in this high office to which thou art called it is 
thy bounden duty, and should be thy constant care, to 
show an example of godly life to all those given into 
thy charge ? 


BE. TI will. 


Con. Wilt thou ever cherish as a sacred trust the - 
power now to be committed unto Thee, and solemnly 
pledge thyself to exercise all care and discretion in | 
the choice of those upon whom in Christ’s Name thou 
shalt bestow the gift of Holy Orders ? 


BiH ser), 


Con. Wilt thou hold thyself ever ready to do ser- 
vice in Christ’s Name to all men, so far as thou art | 


CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 351 


able, remembering that the noblest title of a Bishop 
_is ‘‘Servant of the servants of God’’ ? 


B.E. I will. 


Con. Wilt thou, for the sake of the Lord’s Name, 
seek ever to be gentle and tender to the sorrowful 
and those who suffer want ? 


BE, I will. 


Con. Wilt thou ever bethink thee that thou shouldst 
be a father unto thy people, and most of all show 
love unto the little ones among thy flock; remem- 
bering how Christ spake: ‘‘Suffer the little children 
to come unto Me, and forbid them not, for of such is 
the kingdom of God’’? 


BE. TI will. 


Con. The Lord keep thee in these things, well- 
beloved brother, and strengthen thee in all goodness. 
R. Amen. 


The Consecrator continues: 


Dost thou believe, according to the measure of thy 
understanding and the powers of thy mind, in the 
Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, from 
Whom, by Whom, and in Whom are all things in 
heaven and earth, visible and invisible, bodily and 
spiritual ? 


B.E. I do. 


Con. The Lord increase this faith in thee, well- 
beloved brother in Christ, that thou mayest lead thy 
flock to a knowledge of the Divine Wisdom. 

R. Amen, 


The Consecrator and the Bishop Elect each assume 
the Hucharistic vestments. The Consecrator faces 
the Altar and begins the Holy Eucharist. After the 
Absolution, pronounced by the Consecrator, the Bishop 
lect, escorted by the assistant Bishops and their sever- 


352 CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 


al attendants, proceeds to the side Altar. The Conse- 
crator and the Bishop Elect both say the Eucharist in 
the customary manner up to the end of the Gradual, the — 
following Collect and Epistle being used: 


THE COLLECT 


Almighty everlasting God, by Whose Spirit the 
whole body of the Church is made holy and govern- 
ed, do Thou pour forth Thy sanctifying grace into 
the heart of this Thy servant who is about to be 
numbered among the shepherds and rulers of Thy 
Church, that with pure heart and open mind he may 
faithfully receive of the plenitude of the Spirit. 
Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Collect of the Day and the Collect for Peace fol- 
low here. 


THE EPISTLE 


The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle 
is taken from the second chapter of the Acts of the 
Apostles, beginning at the first verse. 


When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they 
were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly 
there came a sound from heaven, as ot a rusning 
mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they 
were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven 
tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them: 
and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and 
began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave — 
them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jeru- 
salem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under — 
heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, the 
multitude came together, and were confounded, be- 
cause that every man heard them speak in his own 
language. And they were all amazed, and marvel- 
led, saying one to another: Behold, are not all these — 
which speak Galileans? And how hear we every | 
man in our own tongue wherein we were born? Par-— 
thians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in : 


CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 353 


Mesopotamia, and in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pon- 
tus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and 
in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers 
of Rome, Jews and Proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, 
we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonder- 
ful works of God. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Gradual being finished, the Bishop Elect is es- 
corted by the assistant Bishops to the Consecrator, who 
from the faldstool thus addresses him: 


It appertains to a Bishop to consecrate, to ordain, 
to offer sacrifice, to anoint, to bless, to loose and to 
bind, to baptize and to confirm, to preside, to in- 
terpret and to judge. 


Rising, he continues: 


Let us then pray, dearest brethren, that Almighty 
God, in His great lovingkindness and watchful care 
over His Church, may bestow upon this Bishop Elect 
a plentiful grace for the performance of this sacred 
ministry. R. Amen, 


All kneel and sing the following Litany, during which 
the Bishop Elect lies prostrate: 


LITANY 


God the Father, seen of none, 

God the co-eternal Son, 

God the Spirit, with Them One, 
Hear us, Holy Trinity. 


God Eternal, mighty King, 

Unto Thee our love we bring; 

Through the world Thy praises ring; 
We are Thine, O Trinity. 


Christ, the Lord of Life and Light, 
Ruler of the starry height, 
Fount of glory infinite, 

Thee we worship, Master. 


354 


CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 


Mighty Lord, we hail Thee here, 

Recognize Thy Presence dear, 

Feel and know that Thou art near, 
Keeping thus Thy promise. 


Though Thy Face we cannot see 

As of old in Galilee, 

Strong in faith we worship Thee, 
Ever-present Master. 


From our fathers we have heard 
Of the gift Thy Hand conferred; 
We have proved Thy holy word; 


Be that gift outpoured. 


Though Thy form from earth hath gone, 
Thine Apostles handed on 
Sacramental benison; 

Be that blessing with us. 


We this power would now convey; 

Strengthen Thou our hands, we pray, 

Pour Thy might through us to-day; 
Hear us, Holy Master. 


Monarch, at Thy Feet we kneel, 
For Thy servant we appeal, 
Fill his heart with holy zeal, 

In Thy service, Master. 


Thou of holy Church the Head, 

Mystic power upon him shed, 

By Thy love may he be led; 
Hear us, Holy Master. 


Link in mystic bond with Thee, 
This Thy Bishop, that he be 
From the world and self set free 
By Thy power, O Master. 


May he stand before Thy Face 
Filled with love and heavenly grace; 
Grant him with Thy saints a place 

Near Thee, Lord and Master. 


CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 355 


Just before this the Consecrator rises, receives the staff 
_ and turns towards the prostrate Bishop Elect. The as- 
- sistant Bishops do likewise. Together they chant these 
three verses, blessing him at the appointed places: 


We beseech Thee, hear our prayer; 
Bless + Thy servant, prostrate there; 
Hold him in Thy loving care; 

Hear us, Holy Trinity. 


Hear Thy servants as they pray; 

Help Thy chosen one to-day, 

Bless + and + hallow him for aye; 
Hear us, Holy Trinity. 

Pour Thy lovingkindness great 

On Thy chosen candidate; 

Bless + him, + hallow, + consecrate; 
Hear us, Holy Trinity. 


The Bishops kneel, and the following verse is suny 


God the Father, seen of none, 
God the Co-eternal Son, 
God the Spirit, with Them One, 
We are Thine, O Trinity. 


At the conclusion of the Litany the people are seated. 
Henceforward in all parts of the ceremony additional 
to the usual course of the Holy Eucharist, the assistant 
Bishops repeat all that is said by the Consecrator, mak- 
ing also the various signs over the Bishop Elect with him. 
One of the clergy holds an open book of the Gospels over 
the neck and shoulders of the Bishop Elect, who kneels 
while the Consecrator, with hands extended over him, re- 
cites the following prayer: 

O Lord Christ, the Fountain of all goodness, Who by 
the operation of the Holy Spirit hast appointed 
divers Orders in Thy Church, and for its greater 
enrichment and perfecting dost pour down Thy gifts 
abundantly upon men, making some to excel in wis- 
dom, others in devotion and yet others to be well. 
skilled in action, pour down upon this Thy servant of 
the fullness of the Holy Ghost, that in the pontifical

dignity to which we are about to raise him he may 
shine resplendent with all manner of heavenly virtue, 
O Thou great Shepherd and Bishop of the souls of 
men, to Whom be praise and adoration from men and 
from the Angel host. R. Amen. 


All kneel as the Veni Creator is sung: 
VENI CREATOR 


Come, Thou Creator Spirit blest, 

And in our souls take up Thy rest; 

Come with Thy grace and heavenly aid, 
To fill the hearts which Thou hast made. 


Great Paraclete, to Thee we cry, 
O highest gift of God most high; 
O living Fount, O Fire, O Love, 
And sweet anointing from above. 


Thou in Thy sevenfold gifts art known; 
Thee, Finger of God’s Hand, we own, 
The promise of the Father, Thou 

Who dost the tongue with power endow. 


Kindle our senses from above, 

And make our hearts o’erflow with love; 
With patience firm and virtue high 
The weakness of our flesh supply. 


Far let us drive our tempting foe, 
And Thine abiding peace bestow; 
So shall we not, with Thee for guide, 
Turn from the path of life aside. 


O may Thy grace on us bestow 

The Father and the Son to know, 

And Thee, through endless time confessed, 
Of both eternal Spirit blest. - 


All glory while the ages run 

Be to the Father and the Son, 

Who gave us life; the same to Thee, 
O Holy Ghost, eternally. Amen. 


CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 357 


The people remain kneeling. The Consecrator and 
the assistant Bishops rise; they lay both hands upon 
the head of the Bishop Elect, and together say slowly 
and distinctly the words of consecration: 


Receive the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a 
Bishop in the Church of God. 


After a pause, with hands extended over the 
new Bishop, the Consecrator continues with the following 
prayer, the assistant Bishops likewise extending their 
hands, and, as already indicated, accompanying him in 
a low voice: 

O God the Father, God the Son, and God the 
Holy Ghost, most blessed and adorable Trinity, Who 
wert and art and art to come, as Thou hast now be- 
stowed upon this Thy servant of Thine awful power, 
and hast deigned to consecrate him as Thy represen- 
tative and a teacher of Thy people, + open, we pray 
Thee, his heart and mind to Thy heavenly grace, that 
he may handle wisely that which he has received and, 
being ever mindful of Thee, he may exercise his sac- 
red power to the honour and glory of Thy holy Name. 
Fulfil in Thy chosen Bishop the perfection of Thy ser- 
vice, and, having entrusted him with the supreme 
dignity, do Thou sanctify him with unction from 
above. 

The head of the newly-made Bishop is then bound 
with a long napkin and the Consecrator anoints him 
with Holy Chrism in token of his authority and dignity 


| as a@ prince of the Church, saying to him: 





| May thy head be anointed and consecrated 
| with heavenly blessing in the pontifical Order, so that 
the power which thou dost receive from on high may 
flow forth from thee in ever greater abundance and 
glory. In the Name of the + Father, and of the + 
/Son, and of the Holy + Ghost.  R. Amen, 


The Consecrator, again extending his hands, says: 


| Thou Who art Wisdom, Strength and Beauty, show 
forth Thy glory in this Thy servant. Let Thy wis- 
dom dwell in his mind and enlighten his understand- 


358 CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 


ing, that in judgment he may be true, and a wise 
counsellor unto his people, discerning in all spirit- 
ual knowledge. May he be strong and of a 
good courage, sustaining his people in the face of 
darkness and despondency, a tower of strength to 
them that falter on the way. Let the beauty of 
holiness shine forth in his conversation and his ac- 
tions. Do Thou fill him, O Lord, with reverence, 
and make him devout and steadfast in Thy service. 
May gentleness adorn his life, that he may win the 
hearts of men and open them to the light of the Holy 
Spirit. Above all, may he be so filled with Thy 
love that he may touch the hearts of men with the 
fire from heaven and bring them from the darkness 
of ignorance into Thy marvellous Light: Thou Who 
livest and reignest, O Trinity of Might and Wisdom 
and Love, one holy God throughout all ages of ages. 
R. Amen. 


The Consecrator, being seated, anoints the hands of 
the new Bishop with the Holy Chrism. He says: 


May these hands be consecrated and hallowed for 
the work of the pontifical Order by this anointing 
with the holy chrism of sanctification. In the Name 
of the + Father, and of the + Son, and of the Holy 
+ Ghost. R. Amen. 


He makes the sign of the cross first over the heart of 
the newly consecrated Bishop, and then over his hands, 
saying : 


Mayest thou abound with the fullness of spir- 
itual + blessing, so that whatsoever thou dost + 
bless may be blessed, and whatsoever thou dost hal- 
low may be hallowed, and that the laying on of 
this consecrated hand may avail for the spiritual 
safeguarding of Thy people: in the Name of our Lord 
Christ. BR. Amen. 


He joins the consecrated hands and binds them with | 
a linen strip. Having cleansed his hands, he proceeds | 








CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 359 


to bless the pastoral staff, pectoral cross and ring. Tak- 
ing the staff in his hands, he says: 


Eternal Triune God, before Whose great white 
throne seven flaming Spirits stand, Whom yet Thou 
dost send forth through all the world, + pour out 
upon this staff Thy sevenfold fire, that it may be a 
rod of power for the ruling and Strengthening of 
Thy Church. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


Holding the cross between his hands, he says: 


Almighty God, Who of Thine own most holy will 
didst offer Thyself as a Sacrifice for all the world, and 
hast by that limitation of Thyself hallowed the sign 
of the cross and made it for ever Thine own, let 
the seven Rays of Thine ineffable glory + shine 
through this sacred symbol, that this holy cross may 
ever be a radiant sun to him who weareth it, and a 
fount of light and benison to all Thy faithful people, 
O Thou Who reignest from the cross for ever. R. 
Amen, 

He holds the ring between his joimed hands, and says: 


O Christ, pure Lord of Love, Whom Angel hosts 
obey, touch Thou with sacred fire this ring which in 
Thy Name we + bless, that he who wears it shall 
ever show Thy love and purity, and all who touch 
it shall know Thy healing grace. R. Amen, 


The new Bishop’s hands are unbound, the napkin is 
removed from his head, and he cleanses his hands. The 
Consecrator presents the staff to the new Bishop, say- 
ing: 

Receive this staff, and wield thy power with care 
as shepherd of Christ’s flock, By virtue of the 
sevenfold fire of God the Holy Ghost be thou all 
things to all men; giving more strength unto the 
“Strong, yet showing gentleness unto the weak; full 
of wisdom for the wise, and for the devout full of 
deep devotion. Yet as the seven flashing colours 
of the bow make but one pure white ray, so shall thy 
sevenfold power be all the one great power of love. 


360 CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 


The new Bishop hands his crosier to his crosier 
bearer. The Consecrator suspends the cross round the 
neck of the new Bishop, saying: 


Receive this cross, remembering that only by the 
perfect sacrifice of the lower nature to the higher 
canst thou fit thyself to bear it worthily. Go forth 
in the power of the cross, and may the sevenfold 
light of the Holy Spirit so shine through thee that 
thou mayest win others to the beauty of sacrifice. 


He places the ring on the ring-finger of the right 
hand of the newly-made Bishop, saying: 


Receive this ring in token of the link which binds 
thee to our Lord, for symbol of thine office as His 
legate to thy people. In His most holy Name, be 
thou a healer of the souls of men, a channel of His 
love. 


Delivering to him the Book of Gospels, closed, which 
had previously been held on his shoulders, he says: 


Receive the Book of the Gospels, and be thou a 
teacher of the Divine Wisdom unto the people en- 
trusted to thee. 


The Consecrator, and after him the assistant Bishops, 
give the salutation of peace to the newly-consecrated 
Bishop, saying: 


Peace be unto thee. 


Newly-Consecrated Bishop. And with thy spirit. 


The new Bishop, accompanied by the assistant 
Bishops and their several attendants, withdraws to the 
side Altar. The Consecrator resumes the Celebration, 
the special Gospel which follows being used: 


THE GOSPEL 


The holy Gospel is taken from the fourteenth chapter | 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the fifteenth | 
verse. | 








CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 361 


JESUS said unto His disciples: Tf will pray the 
Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, 
that He may abide With you for ever; even the Spirit 
of Truth, Whom the world, cannot receive, because 
it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him; but ye know 
Him; for He dwelleth with you, and shall be 
in you. I will not leave you comfortless; I will 
come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth 
Me no more; but ye see Me; because I live, ye shall 
live also. The Comforter, Which is the Holy Ghost, 
Whom the Father will send in My Name, He shall 
teach you all things, and bring all things to your 
remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. 
Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: 
not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not 
your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 


THE OFFERING 


After the Credo and immediately before the Offer- 
tortum is read, the new Bishop presents his offerings to 
the Consecrator. According to ancient custom these 
consist of two small loaves of bread, two torches or 
candles, and two miniature barrels of wine. The 
loaves and barrels are emblazoned with the arms of the 
Consecrator on a golden shield, and those of the new 
Bishop upon a silver shield, The newly-consecrated 
Bishop, accompanied by his assistant Bishops, then pro- 
ceeds to the south end of the high Altar and says aloud 
the remainder of the office of the Holy Eucharist with 
the Consecrator word for word. 





IN THE PRAYER OF CONSECRATION 
In the prayer of Consecration the following clause is 
added after the words: “*for all our Bishops, clergy 
and fatthful’’: 
Especially for him, whom in Christ’s holy Name 
‘we have admitted to the Order of the Episcopate. 


After the final blessing the Consecrator and the new 
Bishop assume the cope. Ihe Consecrator proceeds 


! 
362 CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 


to the faldstool. The mitre and gloves of the new Bishop 
are held before the Consecrator and he blesses them. The 
three Bishops place the mitre on the head of the newly- 
consecrated Bishop, the Consecrator saying: 


Receive this mitre, wherewith I crown thee 
for the service of that our most dear Lord, Who, 
although He be God and man, yet He is not two, 
but one Christ; and as in Himself He doth indis- 
solubly unite two natures, so mayest thou in thyself 
for ever join the attributes of wisdom and of love. 


The Consecrator, with the aid of the assistant Bishops, 
puts the gloves on the hands of the New Bishop. 
This being accomplished, the Consecrator rises and says: 


Do Thou, we pray Thee, O Lord, fulfil in Thy ser- 
vant that which is betokened by these visible em- 
plems, so that the virtue which in these garments 
is prefigured by sheen of gold, by flashing of gems 
and cunning of varied embroidery, may continually 
shine forth in his life and actions. BR. Amen. 


The new Bishop is solemnly enthroned. iewre 
Deum Laudamus is sung, during which the newly- 
consecrated: Bishop, attended by the assistant Bishops, 
proceeds around the Church and gives his blessing to 
the people.

Antiphon 
The light of the Lord leadeth him: 
Who giveth wisdom to the godly. 


When the procession returns to the sanctuary, the 
new Bishop is seated on the throne or faldstool, the 
Consecrator standing upon his right hand, and the as- 
sistant Bishops upon his left. The Consecrator turns 
to the people and says: 


The Lord be with you. 
People. And with thy spirit. 
Con. Let us pray. 


O God, the Shepherd and Ruler of all the faithful, 
look down in Thy lovingkindness on this servant of 
Thine, who has now become a pontiff and ruler in 
Thy Church; grant him, we pray Thee, O Lord, both 
by his ministration and by word and example, so 
to profit those over whom he is placed that, together 
with the flock committed to his care, he may continu- 
ally increase in the knowledge of Thy mysteries. - 
Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Consecrator and the assistant Bishops, one on 
either side of him, stand at the gospel side of the 
sanctuary. The new Bishop advances to the middle of the 
Altar and thence gives his solemn benediction as follows: 


Bishop. Blessed be the Name of the Lord. 
People. From this time forth for evermore. 
B. Our help is in the Name of the Lord. 





CONSECRATION OF A BISHOP 365 


P. Who hath made heaven and earth. 


B. (turning to the people). The peace of God, 
which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts 
and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of 
His Son, Christ our Lord; and the blessing of God 
Almighty, the + Father, the 4 Son, and the Holy 
+ Ghost, be amongst you, and remain with you 
always. R. Amen. 


THE HOMAGE 


The newly-consecrated Bishop then pays homage to 
the Consecrator according to the ancient tradition of 
the Church. He advances by three stages from the 
epistle side of the sanctuary towards the Consecrator, 
genuflecting each time and saying: ‘Ad Multos Annos’? 
(‘‘unto many years’’), finally receiving from the Con- 
secrator the salutation of peace. This concluded, the 
procession leaves the chancel.
