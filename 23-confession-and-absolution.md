CONFESSION AND ABSOLUTION 


Absolution is a Sacrament by which persons may be 
restored to a state of spiritual health after the com- 
mission of sin. (See John xx. 22, 23.) The word is — 
derived from the Latin ab, from, and soivere, to loosen. 
Absolution must not be thought of as enabling a man 
to escape the consequences of his misdeeds. It is a 
spiritual process, a loosening from the bondage of sin, 
a process at-one-ment with the Higher Self, a restor- 
ation of that inner harmony of being which is dis- 
turbed by wrong-doing, so that the man can make 
a fresh effort towards righteousness, fortified by the 
uninterrupted flow of the Divine Power within him. 
That this Absolution may be fully effective, it is re- 
quisite that the candidate be anxious to rise above his 
imperfections of nature and to live the higher life. 
A man cannot escape the consequences of his mis- 
deeds, though he can neutralize them by sowing fresh 
causes of a righteous kind. ‘‘Be not deceived: God is 
not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall 
he also reap’? (Galatians vi. 7). : 


In the Liberal .Catholic Church auricular confession 
is entirely optional, and is not required as a preliminary 
to the reception of the Holy Communion. It is intend- 
ed primarily for those who may feel their conscience 
to be troubled with some weighty matter. Its fre- 
quent and systematic practice is not encouraged, since 
it is felt that under such conditions the detailed con- 
fession is apt to become a matter of routine and its 
spiritual value in the life of the individual thereby 
defeated. For all ordinary purposes the general con- 
fession in the Holy Eucharist should suffice. 


It is strictly forbidden to the Priest and the suppliant 
for Absolution respectively to ask and disclose the iden- 
tity of others implicated in any wrongdoing confessed. 
The suppliant comes to confess his own faults, not 
those of others. The Priest should be as sympathetic, 
natural and humane as possible with those who come to 
him to receive Absolution. 


270 CONFESSION AND ABSOLUTION 








Children under seven are not subjects for confession, 
since it is the tradition of the Church that they are not 
capable of serious and responsible sin. Above that age 
and until they are responsible agents they may, in the 
Liberal Catholic Church, make auricular confession (save 
in emergency) only with the consent of one or other of 
the parents. 





The person desiring Absolution kneels at a prie-dieu 
in the church, beside which the Priest is seated. 


THE INVOCATION 


Suppliant (crossing himself). In the Name of 
the Father, }{{ and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost. Amen. Father, give me your blessing, for I 
have sinned. 


Priest. The Lord be in thy + heart and on thy 
+ lips, that thou mayest rightly confess thine of- 
fences. 

THE CONFESSION 


Suppliant. I confess before God Almighty, Father, 
Son, and Holy Spirit, and to you, Father, that I 
have sinned in thought, in desire, in word and deed. 
Especially I have . 


For these and all. my other offences which I can- 
not now remember, I am heartily sorry, firmly purpose 
amendment, most humbly ask remission of Almighty 
God, and of you, Father, absolution and the benefit of 
spiritual counsel and advice. 


The Priest hears the confession without interruption, 
unless that be necessary. He then gives such coun- 
sel as he may think well. In the Liberal Catholic 
usage he does not impose a penance, but may suggest 
that the suppliant should attend the Holy Eucharist, 
with the desire that the power which then comes to him 
shall be used against some particular fault or set of 
faults. This being done, he proceeds to the Absolu- 
tion.

earth to His Church to absolve all those that with
