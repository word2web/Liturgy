PRIME 


As already indicated in the introduction to Vespers, 
Prime is one of the morning, and Complin one of the 
evening, Offices of the Church. The greater services, 
such as the Holy Eucharist, Vespers and Benediction, 
are intended principally to pour out spiritual strength 
upon the world, whereas these minor Offices may not un- 
reasonably be regarded as designed especially for the 
benefit of those who take part in them. 


Prime and Complin are short services, which can be 
led by a layman if necessary, and would therefore. be 
eminently suited for a community Office, for family 
prayers, or for use by a schoolmaster who wished to 
say morning or evening prayers with his boys. They 
also, of course, lend themselves to use in Church; Prime, 
when the Holy Eucharist cannot be celebrated, or as 
a preparation therefor, and Complin as an addition 
to Vespers,-or when Vespers and Benediction are un- 
suitable, as on the evening of Good Friday. 


In order to avoid constant repetition, where Prime 
and Complin are said daily, or where Prime is used in 
conjunction with the Holy Eucharist, other short lec- 
tions selected from any part of this book may at the 
discretion of the Priest be read as lessons instead of 
the Epistle and Gospel. 


The people stand.

CONFITEOR 
All kneel, and say: 


O Lord, Thou hast created man to be immortal, and 
made him to be an image of Thine own eternity; yet 
often we forget the glory of our heritage, and wan- 
der from the path which leads to righteousness. But 
Thou, O Lord, hast made us for Thyself, and our 
hearts are ever restless till they find their rest in 
Thee. Look with the eyes of Thy love upon our mani- 
fold imperfections, and pardon all our shortcomings, 
that we may be filled with the brightness of the ever- 
lasting light, and become the unspotted mirror of Thy 
power and the image of Thy goodness. Through Christ 
our Lord. Amen. 


THE ABSOLUTION 


P. God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, 
bless, + preserve and sanctify you; the Lord in 
His lovingkindness look down upon you and be gra- 
cious unto you; the Lord HX absolve you from all 
your sins, and grant you the grace and comfort of 
the Holy Spirit. R. Amen. 


(If there be no Priest, the ministrant, still kneel- 
ing, says the following instead of the Absolution: 


May the Lord bless us, and XH absolve us from all 


our sins; and may His peace rest upon us this day and 
evermore.

with the people. 


First is intoned the Collect for the Day, and then 
the following: 


P. O Lord, our heavenly Father, almighty and’ ev- 
erlasting God, Who hast safely brought us to the be- 
ginning of this day; defend us in the same with Thy 
mighty power, and grant that this day we may man-

ways that which is righteous in Thy sight. Through 
Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

P. O Lord Christ, we Thy faithful soldiers dedicate 
this new-born day to Thee, praying that it may shine

life, O Thou great King of Love, to Whom be praise- 
and adoration for evermore. R. Amen. 


P. Teach us, O Lord, to see Thy life in all men 
and in all the peoples of Thine earth, and guide our 
nation through its leaders to preserve Thy peace, that 
the menace of war be far from our days, through 
Christ our Lord. KR. Amen. 


THE OFFICE HYMN. 
All rise and sing: 


Now that the daylight fills the sky 
We lift our hearts to Thee on high, 
That Thou, in all we do or say, 

Wilt keep us free from harm to-day. 


May we restrain our tongues from strife 
And shield from anger’s din our life; 
And guard with watchful care our eyes 
From earth’s absorbing vanities, 


May this day, dedicate to Thee, 
A day of joyous service be; 

Forgetting self for love of man 
May we fulfil Thy glorious plan. 


Praise God from Whom all blessings flow; 
Praise Him, all creatures here below; 

Praise Him above, ye heavenly Host, 

Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. 


If there is to be a sermon, it is delivered here.
