# Prime

As already indicated in the introduction to Vespers, Prime is one of the morning, and Compline one of the evening, Offices of the Church. The greater services, such as the Holy Eucharist, Vespers and Benediction, are intended principally to pour out spiritual strength upon the world, whereas these minor Offices may not unreasonably be regarded as designed especially for the benefit of those who take part in them.

Prime and Compline are short services, which can be led by a layman if necessary, and would therefore be eminently suited for a community Office, for family prayers, or for use by a schoolmaster who wished to say morning or evening prayers with his boys. They also, of course, lend themselves to use in Church; Prime, when the Holy Eucharist cannot be celebrated, or as a preparation therefor, and Compline as an addition to Vespers, or when Vespers and Benediction are unsuitable, as on the evening of Good Friday.

In order to avoid constant repetition, where Prime and Compline are said daily, or where Prime is used in conjunction with the Holy Eucharist, other short lessons selected from any part of this book may at the discretion of the Priest be read as lessons instead of the Epistle and Gospel.

## Confiteor

*All kneel, and say:*

O Lord, Thou hast created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of Thine own eternity; yet often we forget the glory of our heritage, and wander from the path which leads to righteousness. But Thou, O Lord, hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts are ever restless till they find their rest in Thee. Look with the eyes of Thy love upon our manifold imperfections, and pardon all our shortcomings, that we may be filled with the brightness of the everlasting light, and become the unspotted mirror of Thy power and the image of Thy goodness. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

## The Absolution

**P.** God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve and sanctify you; the Lord in His lovingkindness look down upon you and be gracious unto you; the Lord absolve you from all your sins, and grant you the grace and comfort of the Holy Spirit.  
**R.** Amen.

> *If there be no Priest, the ministrant, still kneeling, says the following instead of the Absolution:*  
>   
> May the Lord bless us, and absolve us from all our sins; and may His peace rest upon us this day and evermore.  
>   
> **C.** Thanks be to God.

## The First Psalm

*The people stand, and the Psalm is sung.*

*Antiphon*  
Ye shall stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord.  
At morning and likewise at even.

1. O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.  
2. Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving: and show ourselves glad in Him with psalms.  
3. The sea is His, and He made it: and His hands prepared the dry land.  
4. He is the Lord our God: and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.  
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.

*Antiphon*  
Ye shall stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord.  
At morning and likewise at even.

## The Collects

**P.** Let us pray.

*All kneel. If a ministrant leads the service, he kneels with the people.*

*First is intoned the Collect for the Day, and then the following:*

**P.** O Lord, our heavenly Father, almighty and everlasting God, Who hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day; defend us in the same with Thy mighty power, and grant that this day we may manfully strive against sin and selfishness, that all our doings may be ordered by Thy governance, to do always that which is righteous in Thy sight. Through Christ our Lord.  
**R.** Amen.

**P.** O Lord Christ, we Thy faithful soldiers dedicate this new-born day to Thee, praying that it may shine in Thy service as a pure pearl in the chaplet of our life, O Thou great King of Love, to Whom be praise and adoration for evermore.  
**R.** Amen.

**P.** Teach us, O Lord, to see Thy life in all men and in all the peoples of Thine earth, and guide our nation through its leaders to preserve Thy peace, that the menace of war be far from our days, through Christ our Lord.  
**R.** Amen.

## The Office Hymn

*All rise and sing:*

> Now that the daylight fills the sky  
> We lift our hearts to Thee on high,  
> That Thou, in all we do or say,  
> Wilt keep us free from harm to-day.  
>   
> May we restrain our tongues from strife

> From earth's absorbing vanities.  
>   
> May this day, dedicate to Thee,  
> A day of joyous service be;  
> Forgetting self for love of man  
> May we fulfil Thy glorious plan.

> Praise Him, all creatures here below;  
> Praise Him above, ye heavenly Host,

## The Third Psalm

*The people stand and sing:*

*Antiphon*  
Heaviness may endure for a night.  
But joy cometh in the morning.

1. The just man shall be as the lily,  
   Even as a morning without cloud.  
2. As the tender grass springing up,  
   As clear shining after rain.  
3. The righteous shall be clearer than the sun,  
   He shall shine forth as the light.  
4. His light shall break forth as the morning,  
   His righteousness shall go before him,  
   And the glory of the Lord shall be his rearward.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.  
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.

*Antiphon*  
Heaviness may endure for a night.  
But joy cometh in the morning.

**P.** Let us pray.  
*The people kneel.*

**P.** Be with us, Lord, throughout this day, that in all our work, begun, continued and ended in Thee, we may glorify Thy holy Name, Who livest for ever and ever.  
**R.** Amen.

*They remain kneeling.*

**P.** Breathe on us, O Spirit of God.  
**C.** In Thy strength we can do all things.

**P.** May our hearts be filled with Thy love.  
**C.** In Thy strength we can do all things.
