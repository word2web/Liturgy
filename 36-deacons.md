THE ORDINATION OF DEACONS 





The Bishop celebrates the Holy Eucharist, at which 
the following special Collect and Epistle are used: 


THE COLLECT 


Almighty everlasting God, by Whose Spirit the 
whole body of the Church is made holy and govern- 
ed, do Thou pour forth Thy sanctifying grace into 
the hearts of these Thy servants, who are about to 
pe numbered among the Deacons of Thy Church, that 
with pure heart and: open mind they may faithfully 
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Through Christ 
our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Collect of the Day and the Collect for Peace fol- 
low here. 


THE EPISTLE 


The Epistle is taken from the fourth chapter of the 
Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians, be- 
ginning at the seventh verse. 


But unto every one of us is given grace according 
to the measure of the gift of Christ. And He gave 
some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evange- 
lists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the’ per- 
fecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for 
the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in 
the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son 
of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of 
the stature of the fullness of Christ. That we hence- 
forth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and 
carried about with every wind of doctrine; but, 
speaking the truth in love, may grow up into Him 
in all things, Who is the head, even Christ; from 
Whom the whole body fitly joined together and com- 
pacted by that which every joint supplieth, accord- 


ORDINATION OF DEACONS 329 


ing to the effectual working in the measure of every 
part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying 
of itself in love. 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


The Epistle being ended, the Bishop takes his seat 
upon a faldstool before the Altar. The ordinands come 
forward bearing lighted candles, and a Priest appointed 
for the purpose presents them to the Bishop, saying: 

Right Reverend Father, our holy Mother the 
Church catholic prays that you would ordain these 
Subdeacons here present to the charge of the Diacon- 
ate. 


Bishop. Knowest thou them to be worthy ? 


P. As far as human frailty allows me to judge, I 
do both know and attest that they are worthy of the 
charge of this office. 


B. Thanks be to God. 


The ordinands are then seated, and the Bishop charges 
the clergy and people as follows: 

Dearly beloved brethren, these Subdeacons here 
before you are presented for the Order of the Diacon- 
ate, to be irrevocably set apart for the service of 
Christ by the gift of God’s most holy Spirit. Mind- 
ful of the sacred trust reposed in us, we have sought 
to ensure that only such as may be profitable to 
Christ’s holy Church be thus presented; yet for fur- 
ther precaution it is seemly that we should enquire 
if any know cause or just impediment why these 
persons should not be admitted to the exercise of the 
Deacon’s ofiice. If, then, any of you know aught 
against them, in the Name of God and for the benefit 
of His Church, let him boldly come forward and 
speak; howbeit, let him be mindful of his own estate. 


After a pause, the Bishop, addressing himself to the 
ordinands, charges them as follows: 
Dearly beloved sons, who are now about to be 


330 ORDINATION OF DEACONS 


raised to the Order of Deacon, do you endeavour 
to receive it worthily, and blamelessly to fulfil its 
duties when you have received it. It appertains 
to the Deacon to minister at the Altar, to read or 
intone the Gospel, to preach, and in the absence of 
the Priest to baptize. Wherefore, dearly beloved sons, 
as now you are charged to minister to the flock of 
Christ, be you raised above all unworthy propensities 
which war against the soul; be seemly, courteous in 
demeanour, and full of noble desires and of love for 
God and man, as befits the ministers of Christ and 
stewards charged to dispense the mysteries of God. 
And as you now have a share in offering and dis- 
pensing the Body and Blood of the Lord, as Holy 
Writ has it: ‘‘Be ye clean, ye that bear the ves- 
sels of the Lord.’’ Be it your care to set forth to 
others, by living deeds, the gospel your lips will pro- 
claim to them, that of you it may be said: ‘‘How 
beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him 
that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace.’’ 


The ordinands rise. 


B. Will you thus strive to use worthily the powers 
entrusted to you? 


Ordinands. I will. 


B. The Lord keep you in all these things, well- 
beloved sons, and strengthen you in all goodness. 
R. Amen. 


The Bishop rises and addresses the people as follows: 


Let us pray, dearest brethren, that Almighty God 
in His great lovingkindness and watchful care over 
His Church may bestow a plentiful grace upon these 
Subdeacons now about to be raised to the Order of 
the Diaconate. 


LITANY 


All kneel and sing the following Litany, during which 
the ordinands lie prostrate. 


ORDINATION OF DEACONS 331 


Should the Subdiaconate have been conferred dur- 
ing this same service, this Litany will already have been 
sung, and will not therefore be repeated. 


God the Father, seen of none, 

God the co-eternal Son, 

God the Spirit, with Them One; 
Hear us, Holy Trinity. 


God Eternal, mighty King, 

Unto Thee our love we bring; 

Through the world Thy praises ring; 
We are Thine, O Trinity. 


Christ, the Lord of Life and Light, 
Ruler of the starry height, 
Fount of glory infinite, 

Thee we worship, Master. 


Mighty Lord, we hail Thee here, 

Recognize Thy Presence dear, 

Feel and know that Thou art near, 
Keeping thus Thy promise. 


Though Thy face we cannot see 

As of old in Galilee, 

Strong in faith we worship Thee, 
Ever-present Master. 


From, our fathers we have heard 

Of the gift Thy Hand conferred; 

We have proved Thy holy word; 
Be that gift outpoured. 


Though Thy form from earth hath gone, 
Thine Apostles handed on 
Sacramental benison; 

Be that blessing with us. 


We this power would now convey, 

Strengthen Thou our hands, we pray, 

Pour Thy might through us to-day, 
Hear us, Holy Master. 


332 ORDINATION OF DEACONS 


Monarch, at Thy Feet we kneel, 
For Thy servants we appeal, 
Fill their hearts with holy zeal 

In Thy service, Master. 


Thou of holy Church the Head, 

Mystic power upon them shed, 

By Thy love may they be led; 
Hear us, Holy Master. 


Link in mystic bond with Thee 
These Thy Deacons; may they be 
From the world and self set free 

By Thy power, O Master, 


May they stand before Thy Face 

Filled with love and heavenly grace; 

Grant them with Thy saints a place 
Near Thee, Lord and Master. 


The three verses which follow are sung by the Bishop 
only: 


We beseech Thee, hear our prayer; 
Bless -- Thy servants, prostrate there; 
Hold them in Thy loving care; 

Hear us, Holy Trinity. 


Hear Thy servants as they pray; 

Help Thy chosen ones to-day, 

Bless + and + hallow them for aye; 
Hear us, Holy Trinity. 

Pour Thy lovingkindness great 

On each chosen candidate; 

Bless + them, + hallow, + consecrate; 
Hear us, Holy Trinity. 

All sing: 

God the Father, seen of none, 

God the co-eternal Son, 

God the Spirit, with Them One, 
We are Thine, O Trinity. 


ORDINATION OF DEACONS 333 


The people are seated. 


The Bishop rises, and with hands extended towards the 
ordinands, who kneel before him, says the following 
prayer: 

O Lord Christ, the Fountain of all goodness, Who 
by the operation of the Holy Spirit hast appointed 
divers Orders in Thy Church, and for its greater en- 
richment and perfecting dost pour down Thy gifts 
abundantly upon men, we pray Thee to + open to 
Thy heavenly grace the hearts and minds of these 
Thy servants who are about to be numbered among 
the Deacons of Thy Church, that through them Thy 
power may abundantly flow for the service of Thy 
people. For our part, as men lacking the divine 
insight, and ignorant of the supreme judgment, we 
have enquired into their lives to the best of our 
ability. But what to us is unknown cannot escape 


Thee, O Lord, nor are hidden things concealed from - 


Thee. Thou penetratest all secrets, Thou art the 
Searcher of hearts, Thou wilt test their lives by Thy 
heavenly judgment, wherein Thou dost ever prevail. 
Wherefore we pray Thee, O Lord and heavenly Mas- 
ter, to hallow and strengthen with Thy mighty + 
blessing these whom we now set apart to the end 
that they may minister at Thy holy Altars and to 
the well-being of Thy faithful people. Increase in 
them, O Lord, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, that they 
may be strong and of a good courage and, surmount- 
ing doubt and imperfection, may purchase to them- 
selves a good degree and a great boldness in the faith, 
O Thou great Ruler of the hearts of men, to Whom 
be praise and adoration from men and from the 
Angel host. R. Amen. ; 


All kneel while the Veni Creator is sung. 


VENI CREATOR 


Come, Thou Creator Spirit blest, 

And in our souls take up Thy rest; 

Come with Thy grace and heavenly aid, 
To fill the hearts which Thou hast made. 


334 ORDINATION OF DEACONS 





Great Paraclete, to Thee we cry; 

O highest gift of God most high; 
O living Fount, O Fire, O Love, 
And sweet anointing from above. 


Thou in Thy sevenfold gifts art known; 
Thee, Finger of God’s Hand, we own; 
The promise of the Father, Thou 

Who dost the tongue with power endow. 


Kindle our senses from above, 

And make our hearts o’erflow with love; 
With patience firm and virtue high 

The weakness of our flesh supply. 


Far let us drive our tempting foe, 
And Thine abiding peace bestow; 

So shall we not, with Thee for guide, 
Turn from the path of life aside. 


O may Thy grace on us bestow 

The Father and the Son to know, 

And Thee, through endless times confessed, 
Of both eternal Spirit blest. 


All glory while the ages run 

Be to the Father and the Son, 

Who gave us life; the same to Thee, 
O Holy Ghost, eternally. Amen. 


The Bishop rises and imposes his right hand upon the 
head of each ordinand, saying to each: 


Receive the Holy Ghost for the office and work of 
a Deacon in the Church of God. 


The Bishop with his hand extended towards the new- 
ly ordained Deacons, continues: 


O God the Holy Ghost, Who hast deigned to de- 


scend upon these Thy servants in spirit and in power, 
strengthen them with Thy sevenfold might for the 


ORDINATION OF DEACONS 335 


faithful performance of this ministry. May that 
power ever flow forth in their actions and kindle 
their speech; may they be resolute and steadfast in 
the service of their brethren, so that, having al- 
ways the witness of a good conscience, they may 
continue strong and stable in Christ, pillars in the 
temple of our God, Thou Who with the Father and 
the Son livest and reignest, God throughout all ages 
of ages. R. Amen. 


The Bishop is seated, and vests each new Deacon with 
a white stole, which is placed over the left shoulder and 
fastened under the right arm. He makes the sign of 
the cross over the heart of each new Deacon, as he says: 


Take thou the white + stole for a symbol of 
thine office; remembering that as for the service 
and love of man thou dost exercise the power which 
now is in thee, so will it flow through thee in ever 
greater fullness and glory. 


The Bishop vests each new Deacon with a dalmatic, 
saying: 

The Lord clothe thee with the vesture of gladness 
and ever encompass thee with the dalmatic of jus- 
tice. In the Name of the + Father, and of the 
-+ Son, and of the Holy + Ghost. R. Amen. 


The Bishop delivers to each new Deacon the Book 
of Gospels, saying - 

Take thou authority to read the Gospel in the 
Church of God, both for the living and the dead. 
In the Name of the + Father, and of the + Son, 
and of the Holy + Ghost. R. Amen. 


He rises, and blesses them in this wise: 


O Christ, the Lord of Love, Who, by the heavenly 
and earthly service of Angels which Thou orderest, 
dost shed over all the elements the efficacy of Thy 
will, pour out on these Thy servants of the fullness of 
Thy + blessing, that in the fellowship of those 
glorious Angels they may minister worthily at Thy 








336 ORDINATION OF DEACONS 





holy Altars, and being endowed with heavenly virtue 
and grace they may ever be watchful and zealous in 
the service of Thy Church, Thou Who reignest for 
ever and ever. R. Amen. 


One of the newly ordained Deacons reads the Gospel. 


THE GOSPEL 


The holy Gospel is taken from the fifteenth chapter 
of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the third 
verse. 


And He spake this parable unto them, saying: 
What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he 
lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine 
in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, 
until he find it? And when he hath found it, he 
layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he 
cometh home, he calleth together his friends and 
neighbours, saying unto them: Rejoice with me, 
for I have found my sheep which was lost. I say 
unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over 
one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety 
and nine just persons, which need no repentance. 


The Holy Eucharist is then continued to its close. 





IN THE PRAYER OF CONSECRATION 


In the Prayer of Consecration the following clause 
is inserted after the words: “‘for all our Bishops, clergy 
and fatthful’’: 


Especially for these whom in Christ’s holy Name 
we have admitted to the Order of the Diaconate.
