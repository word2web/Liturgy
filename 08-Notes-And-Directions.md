# Notes and Directions

## The Church’s Year

The Church’s year divides itself into two portions.  
The first portion, from Advent to Whitsuntide, is devoted to the commemoration of the various scenes in the mystery-drama of the life of Christ, which in itself—as Origen pointed out—is typical of the life of every Christian.  
The second portion, embracing all the Sundays after Trinity, is left for the practice of the virtues inculcated in the former.

It has been thought desirable to assign something in the nature of a leading thought to Sundays in the latter portion not already marked out by the Church, and to certain others in the earlier half of the year. These leading thoughts or intents might have been wider in their range, had it not been for the difficulty of gathering together suitable Epistles and Gospels.

A special day has been set apart as the Festival of the Baptism of our Lord, and the date for the Transfiguration has been advanced, so as to make that occurrence fit into the proper sequence of the Gospel narrative.

In addition to Whitsunday, six Sundays have been marked out for special devotion to the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity: namely, the Sunday before Advent, the three Sundays before Lent, and two others after Trinity. Besides encouraging a devotion that is curiously neglected, this plan has the advantage of introducing red as the colour of some Sundays.

The number of Saints’ Days to be observed in this Calendar is reduced to a minimum. There is much to favour the contention that the whole system of such commemorations is an anachronism, which might be allowed for the most part to drop into abeyance without impairing the reality of our belief in the communion of saints. The Roman Calendar is overladen with saints, of whom few excite any real devotion at this distance of time, while others undoubtedly are mythical or transformed pagan deities. One may well contrast with these the many genuine saints—men and women of to-day—living in our midst. Our clergy, however, are free to observe the various commemorations, if they prefer to do so.

In regard to commemorations, we follow the ordinary custom of the Church. When two festivals concur, we use the service of the more important of the two, and in addition recite the Collect of the other, in order that our people may not overlook it.

## Ecclesiastical Colours

The colour of certain of the vestments and of the Altar frontal varies according to the season of the year or festival being observed.

- **White** is the colour of joy, and is used on great festivals, on those of our Lady, of Angels, and of Saints who are not martyrs. It synthesizes all the colours.

- **Red** is used on festivals of the Holy Ghost, of apostles, and of martyrs. Its influence is that of expansiveness and glowing power.

- **Violet** is used in Lent and Advent, at times of self-examination and preparation, at exorcisms, the visitation of the sick, and at funerals. Lying at the opposite end of the spectrum to red, its influence is cleansing, actinic, piercing.

- **Green** is used after Epiphany and Trinity. It holds the balance in the middle of the spectrum, and its influence is one of sympathy and general good-will.

- **Rose**, by ancient custom, supersedes violet on the Fourth Sunday in Lent and the Third Sunday in Advent, but its use is left to the discretion of the Priest in charge. It indicates the love which is the central thought in those seasons of preparation.

- **Black** is not used in the Liberal Catholic rite.

## The Altar and Its Appointments

The Altar, and not the pulpit, is the central feature of the Church, since it is the celebration of the Divine Mysteries—and not preaching—that is of the essence of our worship.  

At the back of the Altar stands the tabernacle wherein the Blessed Sacrament of Christ’s Body is reserved, giving to the Church the unspeakable privilege of His abiding Presence.  

Six large candles are lighted at the more important services; these, with the lamp which burns before the Altar as a visible token of Christ’s perpetual Presence, represent the “seven Spirits before the throne of God” (Revelation 1:4).

## The Vestments

The vestments worn by the Priest date from the earliest times of Christianity, and are, in point of fact, an adaptation in various respects of the prevailing civil dress of that day. They are part of the general scheme by which spiritual power is spread out upon the congregation; they also have their aesthetic value and symbolical significance. It is not without due and careful consideration that they have been retained in the Liberal Catholic Church.

## Incense

The offering of incense has been retained not only because it is an ancient, beautiful, and honourable custom—typifying the prayers of the saints ascending before the throne of God—but also because it is the universally employed means of helping to purify the hearts and minds of the people and to distribute spiritual power.

## The Sign of the Cross

Two varieties of cross are printed in the Liturgy.  
Wherever the **Maltese cross** appears, it is intended that the people should reverently cross themselves.  
The other **plain crosses** indicate manual acts on the part of the officiant, where he makes the “sign of power” either over himself or others or over objects. These crosses are not made by the congregation, but are printed in order that the latter may more intelligently follow the liturgy.

The use of this sign, whether liturgical or personal, can be traced to the earliest times of Christianity. When a man makes it over himself, it is designed to promote self-recollectedness; to remind him of the Name which it symbolizes, and to help him realize that where that Name is invoked, we trust no evil shall ensue.  

It is a kind of miniature creed expressed in action instead of in words:  
- As we touch first the **forehead** and then the **solar plexus**, it reminds us how “for us men and for our salvation” Christ came down from the Father—who is Head over all—to this earth, to the physical plane, the lower part of His creation;  
- As we touch first the **left shoulder** and then the **right**, we remember that He passed from earth into Hades (typified as on the left hand of God) and proceeded thence to sit in glory forever on the right hand of the Father.  

It further suggests that we consecrate mind and heart and the organs of action to the service of God.

But in addition to all this, the sign of the cross is the Christian “sign of power”; it is a vehicle of spiritual force, flowing sometimes from the Priest to the congregation, sometimes from on high into Priest and people. Made over ourselves, it will draw around us unseen influences which will tend to drive away unwholesome thoughts, and at the same time make it easier to retain what is good.

## The Hymns

Of the few hymns incorporated in the text of this Liturgy, nearly all are translations (sometimes slightly altered) of old Latin hymns.  

Of the others:  
- *O Master, I have promised*,  
- *Take up thy cross, the Master said*,  
- *The Voice that breathed o’er Eden*,  
- *Immortal Love*, and  
- *Great Master, Whose Name is the Healer*  

are favourite hymns (again in slightly adapted form), written respectively by J. E. Bode, C. W. Everest, John Keble, J. G. Whittier, and Lucy Larcom.  

The only hymn by a living author is the beautiful *Closed is the solemn hour*, written by one of our own Church members, Mr. H. Armine Wodehouse, M.A., whom we have also to thank for some very beautiful emendations and additions to the Benediction Litany.  

We who use these hymns owe a tribute of gratitude to their authors.

## On the Saying of Services

The Liturgy is arranged in general for the singing of the public Offices. Where they are said, the sentences of antiphons, psalms, or canticles are repeated alternately by Priest and people. All join in the *Gloria*—also in the *Introit*, the *Gloria in excelsis*, the *Creed*, the *Sanctus*, and the *Communio*.

In the private daily Celebration of the Priest, his server (if he have one) should recite the part assigned to the people. If there be no server, the Priest recites the whole.
