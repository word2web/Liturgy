# Creeds and Acts of Faith

## The Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed

We believe in one God, the Father Almighty,  
Maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all ages; God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten, not made, being of one Substance with the Father, by Whom all things were made. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven,

> *Here all genuflect in reverence for the mystery of the incarnation.*

and was incarnate of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary, and was made man.

> *All rise again.*

And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried. And the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father. And He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead: Whose Kingdom shall have no end.

And we believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, the Giver of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spake by the Prophets. And we believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. And we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

## The Original Nicene Creed<sup>*</sup>

We believe in one God, the Father Almighty,  
Maker of all things both visible and invisible;

And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God; begotten of the Father, only-begotten, that is, of the Substance of the Father; God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten not made, being of one Substance with the Father, by Whom all things were made, both those in heaven and those on earth; Who for us men and for our salvation descended,

> *Here all genuflect*

was incarnate and was made man,

> *All rise again*

suffered, and rose the third day, ascended into the heavens, and cometh to judge the quick and the dead;

And in the Holy Ghost. Amen.

> <sup>*</sup> This is the original Creed of the Council of Nicaea, A.D. 325. The present Creed, called Nicene, which is given just before this, is the result of later additions—most of which were made, or rather approved, at the Council of Constantinople, in A.D. 381.

## Acts of Faith

### I

We believe in one God, the holy and all-glorious Trinity, the Three Who yet are One, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, co-equal, co-eternal;

In God the Father, from Whom do come the worlds and all that is therein, seen or unseen;

And in God the Son most holy, only-begotten from His Father before all ages; not made, but springing forth; being of the Substance of His Father, true God from the true God, true Light from the true Light, by Whom all forms were made; Who for us men came down from heaven,

> *Here all bow low*

and took the robe of matter,

> *All stand erect again*

yet riseth thence again in ever greater glory to a kingdom without end;

And in God the Holy Ghost, the Life-giver, springing forth also from the Father and the Son, equal with Them in glory, Who revealeth Himself through His Angels.

We acknowledge one holy catholic and apostolic Church, one communion of the saints, one baptism for the remission of sin; we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the coming age. Amen.

### II

We believe that God is Love, and Power and Truth and Light; that perfect justice rules the world; that all His sons shall one day reach His Feet, however far they stray. We hold the Fatherhood of God, the Brotherhood of man; we know that we do serve Him best when best we serve our brother man. So shall His blessing rest on us, and peace for evermore. Amen.

### III

We place our trust in God, the holy and all-glorious Trinity, Who dwelleth in the Spirit of man.  
We place our trust in Christ, the Lord of love and wisdom, first among many brethren, Who leadeth us to the glory of the Father, and is Himself the Way, the Truth and the Life.

We place our trust in the Law of Good which rules the world; we strive towards the ancient narrow Path that leads to life eternal; we know that we serve our Master best when we serve our brother man. So shall His power rest upon us, and peace for evermore. Amen.
