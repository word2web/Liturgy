“FORM FOR THE ADMINISTRATION 
~ OF HOLY COMMUNION WITH 
THE RESERVED SACRAMENT 





THE INVOCATION 
Standing before the Altar steps, the Priest says+ 


In the Name of the Father, > and of the Son, and 
of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 


All kneel, and say the Confiteor. 
CONFITEOR 


O Lord, Thou hast created man to be immortal, and 
made him to be an image of Thine own eternity; yet 
often we forget the glory of our heritage, and wander ° 
from the path which leads to righteousness. But 
Thou, O Lord, hast made us for Thyself, and our 
hearts are ever restless till they find their rest in Thee. 
Look with the eyes of Thy love upon our manifold im- 
perfections, and pardon all our shortcomings, that we 
may be filled with the brightness of the everlasting 
light, and become the unspotted mirror of Thy power 
and the image of Thy goodness. Through Christ our 
Lord. Amen. 

THE ABSOLUTION 


P. God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy 
Ghost, bless, + preserve and sanctify you; the Lord 
in His lovingkindness look down upon you and be 
gracious unto you; the Lord > absolve you 
from all your sins, and grant you the grace and com- 
fort of the Holy Spirit. R. Amen. 


P. The Lord be with you. 
c. And with thy spirit. 
P. Let us pray. 


O God, Who in the wonderful Sacrament of the Al- 
tar hast left us a living memorial of Thine eternal 


206 ADMINISTRATION 


Sacrifice; grant us, we beseech Thee, so to venerate 
the sacred mystery of Thy Body and Blood that we 
may ever perceive within ourselves the power of 
Thine indwelling life, and thus, by the glad pouring 
out of our lives in sacrifice, may know ourselves to 
be one with Thee and through Thee with all that lives ; 
Who livest and réignest with the Father in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, God, throughout all ages of 
ages. R. Amen. 


The Priest blesses the people with a Particle, as he 
Says: 


+ Ye that desire to partake of the Body of the Lord, 
draw nigh and receive this most holy Sacrament. 


He administers the Holy Communion to them in the 
usual manner, and when all have recewed, he says: 


Under the veil of earthly things now have we com- 
munion with our Lord Jesus Christ; soon with open 
face shall we behold Him, and rejoicing in His glory 
be made like unto Him. Then shall His true disciples 
be brought by Him with exceeding joy before the 
presence of His Father’s glory. 


If desired, the Communio and Postcommunio from the 


Lucharistic service, or other prayers, may be added. 
THE BENEDICTION

ing, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge 
and love of God, and of His Son, Christ our Lord; 
and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, 
the Son and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you, and re- 
main with you always. R. Amen.
