THE CELEBRATION OF THE 
HOLY EUCHARIST 


COMMONLY CALLED THE MASS 


““Wucharist’? is a Greek word meaning ‘‘thanks- 
giving.’’ The word ‘‘Mass’’ is of uncertain etymo- 
logy; some think the name to be derived from the Latin 
phrase Ite, missa est, with which catechumens or pro- 
bationers are said to have been dismissed in the an- 
cient Church before the chief part of the service—with 
which the Holy Angels are still dismissed at the end 
of it, to fly forth on their glorious errands of mercy 
and blessing. The fact that the term ‘‘Mass’’ has in 
this Liturgy given place to ‘‘Holy Eucharist’’ has no 
doctrinal significance. We have preferred the latter 
title because it expresses more adequately and beauti- 
fully the nature and character of the Service. 


The Holy Eucharist is the central act of Christian 
worship. Designed to help those who take part therein, 
it is intended also to pour out a great flood of spiritual 
power upon the surrounding world at large, and it sum- 
mons the congregation to intelligent and energetic par- 
ticipation in this work. So real is this participation that 
the congregation may expect to feel a great spiritual 
upliftment; indeed, if they have done their work effi- 
ciently, they may experience physical fatigue. But as- 
suredly they will gladly bear this much of inconveni- 
ence for the sake of serving Him. 


The Liturgy of the Holy Eucharist opens with the 
Asperges or sprinkling with consecrated water, whose 
purpose is to prepare the building, to purify and 
steady the thought and feeling of the people, and to 
invoke the presence of an Angel to assist in the wor- 
ship. 

Then follows the Preparation, consisting largely of 
ascription of praise to Almighty God, intended to attune 
the worshippers to high and holy things. This is great- 
ly helped by the Confession and Absolution. The Collect, 


170 HOLY EUCHARIST 





Epistle, Gospel and Creed draw out especially the 
thought of the people, whereas the preceding sections 
have largely worked upon their devotion. 


At the Offertoriwm another phase of the Liturgy is 
introduced. The bread and wine are now brought for- 
ward and offered in the service of God as first-fruits 
of the earth and tokens of our worldly offerings. In 
ancient times produce of various kinds was at this 
place offered for the support of the clergy and the 
poor, and blessed. A little later, in the prayer, ‘We 
lay before Thee, O Lord,’’ these elements are offered 
as a symbol of the sacrifice of ourselves to God’s service. 
Very shortly, in the Prayer of Consecration, they will 
be offered as a channel for Christ’s blessing, and at yet 
a later stage as His most sacred Body and Blood, to be 
used by us as an aid to unite ourselves with His will. Then 
comes the splendid appeal to the congregation to lift 
up their hearts, and, in company with the nine orders 
of Angels whose presence here is invoked, to give 
‘“eucharist’’ or thanks to Almighty God—the Sursum 
Corda and Preface, followed by the Sanctus. 


We have now entered upon the Canon, as it has been 
called since ancient times, the most important section. 
At the beginning of the Prayer of Consecration the 
celebrant proceeds to enumerate the special purposes or 
intentions for which the Sacrifice is to be offered. The 
Liturgy then explains how this great act of worship is 
in itself a mystery-drama, re-enacting in time and space 
the primal cosmic Sacrifice of the Logos, the incarna- 
tion or descent into matter of the Second Person of the 
Blessed Trinity. Now come the Words of Consecration, 
the solemn act by which the bread and wine in their 
natural substance become the Body and Blood of Christ. 
It may help us to understand this great mystery if we 
realize that our own bodies are vehicles or expressions 
of our consciousness, of the indwelling Spirit; so that 
bread and wine which nourish our bodies become here 
the special expression or manifestation of the Christ, 
the channel of His blessing for the nourishing of our 
souls. 


HULY HUA 4 Aart 

All who are present must inevitably be uplifted by 
the radiation of His holy power, and those who receive 
Holy Communion are brought by this blessed privilege 
into close and intimate union with our Lord and Master. 
Rightly do we regard this service as the supreme act 
of Christian worship, and offer thanks to Him Who gave 
it. All the love and devotion which have so freely been 
poured out during the Service, and the infinite abund- 
ance of spiritual force which has been called down from 
on high in response, are gathered together by the direct- 
ing Angel and shed abroad upon the world along with 
the benediction given by the Celebrant. Through the 
ceremony of the Holy Bucharist, each time it is cele- 
brated, there passes forth into the world a wave of peace 
and strength, the effect of which can hardly be over- 
rated; and this, which is indeed the primary object of 


the Service, is achieved at every celebration, whether 


the Priest be alone in his private oratory or minister- 
ing to a vast congregation in some magnificent cathe- 
dral. Therefore it offers to us an unequalled oppor- 
tunity of becoming labourers together with God, of do- 
ing Him true and laudable service by acting as chan- 
nels of His wondrous power.
