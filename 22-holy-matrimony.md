HOLY MATRIMONY 


Christ did not institute marriage, but the Sacrament 
blessing such marriage. This is intended to help the 
parties to live together in a state of love and mutual 
aid. When they have pledged their love and fidelity 
to each other in the presence of Christ, the Priest bless- 
es them in His Name. 


The ring, which is the symbol of their spiritual 
union, is also blessed. 





The Priest must be careful to acquaint himself with 
the legal requirements concerning marriage in his own 
particular country, and before performing any mar- 
riage to satisfy himself that it is free from impediment 
or wWlegality, especially when either of the contract- 
ing parties is of foreign birth or under age. 


THE MARRIAGE SERVICE 


The bridegroom and the bride (on his left), with their 
attendants, stand before the Altar rails. 


THE INVOCATION 


Priest. In the Name of the Father, }4 and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 


Turning to the people, the Priest addresses them as 
follows: 


Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in 
the sight of God, and in the face of this congre- 
gation, to join together this man and this woman in 
holy Matrimony, which is an honourable estate, not by 
any to be enterprised nor taken in hand unadvisedly, 
lightly or wantonly, but reverently, discreetly, advis- 
edly and soberly, in the sight of God. 


Into which estate these two persons come now to 
be joined. Therefore if any man can show any just 


12 


260 HOLY MATRIMONY _ 





cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, 
let him now speak or else hereafter for ever hold 
his peace. 


No impediment being alleged, the Priest questions 
the man and woman separately concerning their consent 
to marry. 


P. (to the man). Wilt thou, N., take N. here pres- 
ent for thy lawful wife according to the rite of our 
holy Mother the Church ? 


The bridegroom answers: I will. 


P. (to the woman). Wilt thou, N., take N. here 
present for thy lawful husband according to the rite 
of our holy Mother the Church ? 


The bride answers: I will. 


The bridegroom places the ring upon a salver held 
before him by an acolyte. The priest sprinkles the ring 
with holy water in the form of a cross, and then 
blesses it, saying: 


Bless -+ O Lord, and + hallow this ring, that she 
who shall wear it may ever Keep true faith unto her 
husband, and so, abiding in Thy peace and in con- 
formity to Thy holy will, may ever live with him 
in love unchanging. Through Christ our Lord. R. 
Amen. 


The ring remains upon the salver wntil required. 


P. Who giveth this woman to be married to this 
man ? 


_ The bride is then given away by her father or friend, 
who places her right hand in that of the Priest, who in 
turn bestows her upon the bridegroom with the words: 


Receive the precious gift of God. 
The bridegroom, taking her right hand in his, re- 
cewves her, to keep her in God’s faith and his own. 


Then shall the bridegroom plight her his troth in 
these words, repeated by him after the Priest: 


HOLY MATRIMONY 26s 





I, N., take thee, N., to be my wedded wife, to have 
and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for 
worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in 
health, to love, to cherish, and to honour, till death 
us here do part; and thereunto, in the presence of 
God and in the power and love of Christ our Lord 
and Master, I plight thee my troth. Amen. 

Then shall they loose hands, and the woman, taking 
the man’s right hand in her own, shall repeat after the 
Priest: 

I, N., take thee, N., to be my wedded husband, to 
have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, 
for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in 
health, to love, to cherish and to honour, till death 
us here do part; and thereunto, in the presence of 
God and in the power and love of Christ our Lord 
and Master, I plight thee my troth. Amen. 

The salwer bearing the ring is brought by an 
acolyte to the bridegroom, who repeats after the 
Priest: 

Bridegroom. (Placing the ring on the thumb of the 
bride’s left hand) In the Name of the Father, (then 
on the forefinger, saying:) and of the Son, (then 
on the next finger, saying:) and of the Holy Ghost, 
(lastly on the ring finger, as he seals his fidelity 
with the word:) Amen. Holding the ring in its place, 
he repeats after the Priest: 

With this ring I thee wed; my truest love I thee 
pledge; with my body I give thee reverence, and 
with all my strength I thee shield. Amen. 

If it should be thought well for the woman to give 
her intended husband a ring, it may be blessed after the 
other mutatis mutandis, and would now be placed upon 
his finger as a pledge of her love and fidelity. No 
words accompany this action, as in the true symbolism 
of the rite the woman fulfils her part rather by the re- 
cewing of the ring. 

The Priest joins their right hands, and after 
touching the forehead of the man and woman with 
holy water, says: 


262 HOLY MATRIMONY 


I join you together in marriage in the Name of 


the Father, + and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. 
Amen. 


Covering their joined hands with the end of his stole, 
he adds: : 


Those whom God hath joined together, let no man 
seek to put asunder. 


Then shall the Priest speak unto the people: 


Forasmuch as N. and N. have consented together 
in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before 
God and this company, and thereto have given and 
pledged their troth .either to other, and have declar- 
ed the same by giving and receiving of a ring and 
by joining of hands; I declare to you that they be 
man and wife together, in the Name of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 





If a special Nuptial Eucharist is to be celebrated, 
the following portion in brackets, which forms part of 
such a Eucharistic Service, is here omitted. The newly- 
married pair kneel. 

[P. O Lord, bless Thy servant and Thy handmaid. | 

C. Who put their trust in Thee. 


P. Pour forth upon them of the fullness of Thy 
love. 


And lighten them with Thy heavenly grace. 
- Send them wisdom from Thy sanctuary. 

And do Thou dwell in their understanding. 

- Be unto them, O Lord, a tower of strength. 
And evermore defend them. : 

. The Lord be with you. 

- And with Thy spirit. 

. Let us pray.

vants, this man and this woman, whom we -+ bless in 
Thy Name; that these persons may surely perform 
and keep the vow and covenant betwixt them made, 
and may so hold ‘their lives in the knowledge and 
love of Thee that they may dwell together in holy 
love and peace. Through Christ our Lord. R. 
Amen. | 





WEDDING HYMN. 


The people stand, but the newly-married pair kneel, 
while the hymn is sung. 


The voice that breathed o’er Eden 
That earliest wedding day, 

The primal marriage blessing— 
It hath not passed away. 


Still in the pure espousal 
Of Christian man and maid 
The Holy Three are with us, 
The threefold grace is said, 


\ 
For dower of blessed children, 
| For love and faith’s sweet sake, 
| For high mysterious union 
Which naught on earth may break. 


On Thee, O loving Father, | 
Thy humble servants wait; 

| Their future life together 

| To Thee they consecrate. 


O Christ, the King of glory, 
Whom Angel hosts obey, 

: Keep these Thy faithful soldiers 

In love and truth alway. 


Shine on them, Holy Spirit, 
And bless them as they kneel; 
Inspire them, guard them, guide them, 
Grant them Thy grace to feel, 





264 HOLY MATRIMONY 





O Trinity all-glorious, 
Whose love is like the sea, 
Pour forth Thy benediction 
On these who worship Thee. 


For them a new life opens; 
May it be Thine alone— 
A sacrifice, a service, 
Before Thine Altar-Throne. Amen, 


The Priest pronounces this blessing over the bride 
and bridegroom. 


Almighty God pour upon you the riches of His 
grace, sanctify and + bless you, that you may serve 
Him both in body and soul, and live together in 
holy love unto your lives’ end. R. Amen. 


If the Nuptial Eucharist is to be celebrated, it now 
follows. 


THE NUPTIAL EUCHARIST. 
CANTICLE 
Antiphon ‘ 
Now abideth faith, hope, love. 
But the greatest of these is love. 


1. Blessed are all they that love the Lord: and 
walk in His ways. 


2. For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: 
O well is thee and happy shalt thou be. 


3. They that put their trust in the Lord shall be 
even as the Mount Zion: which may not be memoweH, 
but standeth fast for ever. 


4. The hills stand about Jerusalem: even so 
standeth the Lord round about His people, from this 
time forth for evermore. 


Antiphon 
Now abideth faith, hope, love. 
But the greatest of these is love. 


HOLY MATRIMONY 265 


THE COLLECT 


O God, Who hast consecrated the state of marriage 
to such an excellent mystery that in it is signified the 
spiritual marriage and unity betwixt Christ and: His 
faithful people, grant unto these Thy servants that, 
casting aside all fear and selfishness and abiding 
in Thy holy love, they may so pass through things 
temporal that they may continually increase in the 
knowledge of things eternal, through Christ our 
Lord. R. Amen, 


THE EPISTLE 


The Epistle is taken from the thirteenth chapter of 
the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corin- 
thians, beginning at the first verse. 


Though I speak with the tongues of men and of 
Angels, and have not love, I am become as sound- 
ing brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have 
the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, 
and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so 
that I could remove mountains, and have not love, 
I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods 
to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be 
burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing. 
Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; 
love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not 
behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not 
easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in 
iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, 
believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth ali 
things. Love never faileth: but whether there be pro- 
phecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, 
they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, 
it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and 
we prophesy in part. But when that which is per- 
fect is come, then that which is in part shall be done 
away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I 
understood as a child, I thought as a child: but 
when I became a man, I put away childish things. 
For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then 


266 HOLY MATRIMONY 





face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I 
know even as also I am known. And now abideth 
faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of 
these is love. 

Here endeth the Epistle. 


THE GRADUAL 


1. The just shall shine and shall run to and fro: 
like sparks among the reeds. 


2. They shall judge nations, and rule over people: 
and their Lord shall reign for ever. 


38. They that trust in Him shall understand the 
truth: and they that are faithful in love shall rest 
in Him; for grace and peace is to His elect. 


4. He that loveth wisdom loveth life: and they 
that seek her early shall be filled with joy. 


5. He that holdeth her fast shall inherit glory: 
and wheresoever she entereth the Lord will bless. 


6. They that serve her shall minister to the Holy 
One: and them that love her the Lord doth love. 


7. She is more precious than rubies: and all the 
things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto 
her. 


8. Her ways are ways of pleasantness: and all her 
paths are peace. 


THE GOSPEL 


The holy Gospel is taken from the fifteenth chapter 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the first 
verse. 


I am the true vine, and My Father is the hus- 
bandman. Every branch in Me that beareth not 
fruit He taketh away: and every branch that bear- 
eth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more 
fruit. Now ye are clean through the word which 
I have spoken unto you. Abide in Me, and I in you. 
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it 
abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide 


HOLY MATRIMONY 267 


a ee ee 
in Me. I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that 
abideth in Me, and I in him, the same pringeth forth 
much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing. If 
aman abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch, 
and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them 
into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide 
in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what 
ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein 
is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; 
so shall ye be My disciples. As the Father hath lov- 
ed Me, so have I loved you; continue ye in My love. 
If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My 
love; even as I have kept My Father’s command- 
ments, and abide in His love. These things have 
I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in 
you, and that your joy might be full. 


BEFORE THE COMMEMORATION OF THE 
SAINTS 
The Priest stands at the Epistle corner of the Altar, 
turning towards the newly-married pair who kneel be- 
fore him, and the following Versicles and Responses 
and Prayers are sung: 
P. O Lord, bless Thy servant and Thy handmaid. 
C. Who put their trust in Thee. 
P. Pour forth upon them of the fullness of Thy 
love. 
. And lighten them with’ Thy heavenly grace. 
. Send them wisdom from Thy sanctuary. 
. And do Thou dwell in their understanding. 
. Be unto them, O Lord, a tower of strength. 
. And evermore defend them. 
. The Lord be with you. 
And with Thy spirit. 
. Let us pray. 
eternal God, Creator and Preserver of all man- 
kind, Giver of all spiritual grace, the Author of

everlasting life, send Thy blessing upon these Thy 
servants, this man and this woman, whom we -+ bless 
in Thy Name; that these persons may surely perform 
and keep the vow and covenant betwixt them made, 
and may so hold their lives in the knowledge and love 
of Thee that they may dwell together in holy love 
and peace. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


COMMUNIO 


The eye of the Lord is upon them that love Him: 
even upon them that rest on His lovingkindness. 


The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord: and 
the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the 
kingdom of their Father. 


“For every good gift and every perfect gift is from 
above: and cometh down from the Father of Lights, 
in Whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turn- 
ing. 

POSTCOMMUNIO 


P. O Lord Christ, Thou Who art the Well of in- 
finite compassion, look with the tender eyes of Thy 
love upon Thy servant and Thy handmaiden; strength- 
en them that the light of Thy glory may ever 
burn brightly in their hearts, O Thou great King of 
Love, to Whom be praise and adoration from men 
and from the Angel host. R. Amen. 


If the father be dead or wnavoidably absent, and no 
friend can be found to take his place, the bride herself 
may place her right hand in that of the Priest, but the 
older form is to be preferred when it is possible.
