HOLY UNCTION AND 
COMMUNION OF THE SICK 





The purposes of the Sacrament of Holy Unction are: 
(a) to aid in the restoration of bodily health, (b) to 
prepare the man for death, (¢) to which may be added 
remission of sin, since it also involves a form of Absolu- 
tion. Notwithstanding the trend of custom in the 
Latin Church, which has been to limit the administra- 
tion of this rite to those in grave danger of death, 
it is desirable that the rite should be more generally 
employed as an aid to recovery from any serious sick- 
ness. For this reason it is among us called ‘‘ Holy 
Unction,’’ rather than ‘‘Extreme Unction,’’ though the 
latter name is sometimes said to originate from the 
idea that it is the last of the unctions given to the 
ordinary Christian, those of Baptism and Confirma- 
tion preceding it. 


Holy Unction is not to be regarded as having in 
ordinary circumstances any quasi-miraculous effect. It 
is intended simply to aid the normal processes of nature 
by freeing the body from lower influences and opening 
it to spiritual influence. 


It is desirable that the person to be anointed should 
receive Holy Communion, if he be capable of doing so. 
In this Liturgy it has been thought well that this 
should take place after the Anointing—for which there 
is abundance of precedent in early times—and that 
the Confession and Absolution should be incorporated 
in the rite of Holy Unction. 


If Communion of the Sick is to be administered 
apart from Holy Unction, the form for the Adminis- 
tration of Holy Communion with the reserved Sacra- 
ment on page 205 should be used, unless a complete 
Celebration is to take place in the house. 








HOLY UNCTION 283 


If convenient, a table should be provided, covered 
with a linen cloth and bearing upon it a cross and two 
lighted candles. The Priest wears a violet stole. 


THE INVOCATION 


P. In the Name of the Father, 4 and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen, 


The Priest now touches the forehead of the patient 
with holy water and sprinkles his surroundings. 


*[P. Hear the words of the Apostle James: 


Is any sick among you? Let him call for the 
elders of the Church; and let them pray over him, 
anointing him with oil in the Name of the Lord. 
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the 
Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed 
sins, they shall be forgiven him. Pray for one an- 
other, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent 
prayer of a righteous man availeth much, | 


CONFITEOR 


The sick man should now make confession of his of- 
fences, reciting the Confiteor, or if he feel his conscience 
sufficiently troubled with any weighty matter, making 
@ special confession (but without the usual form and 
prelimmaries). If the patient be very weak, the Con- 
fiteor may be said on his behalf by the Priest or another, 
or it suffices that he make a mental act of aspiration. 


O Lord, Thou hast created man to be immortal, and 
made him to be an image of Thine own eternity; 
yet often we forget the glory of our heritage, and 
wander from the path which leads to righteousness. 
But Thou, O Lord, hast made us for Thyself, and 
our hearts are ever restless till they find their rest 
in Thee. Look with the eyes of Thy love upon my mani- 
fold imperfections, and pardon all my shortcomings; 
that I may be filled with the brightness of the ever-

lasting light, and become the unspotted mirror of 
Thy power, and the image of Thy goodness. Through 
Christ our Lord. Amen. 


THE-UNCTION* 


Taking upon his thumb some of the holy oil for the 
sick, the Priest anoints in the form of a@ cross the or- 
gans of sense, using the words hereinunder specified: 


Upon the closed eyelids: 

P. By this holy + unction and of His most ten- 
der love, the Lord pardon thee whatever faults thou 
hast committed through seeing. R. Amen. 


Upon the ears: 


P. By this holy + unction and of His most ten- 
der love, the Lord pardon thee whatever faults thou 
hast committed through hearing. R. Amen. 


Upon the nostrils: 


P. By this holy + unction and of His most ten- 
der love, the Lord pardon thee whatever faults thou 
hast committed through smelling. R. Amen. 


Upon the closed lips: 


P. By this holy + unction and of His most ten- 
der love, the Lord pardon thee whatever faults thou 
hast committed through tasting. R. Amen. 


Upon thie inside of the palms of the hands (but out- 
side in thé case of Priests): 


The feet and reins (i.e., the small of the back) may 
also at this time be anointed, but this is optional. 





* Where there is no reason to think that the illness is 
likely to be fatal, this form of unction is preferably 
omitted; the Priest then proceeds immediately to the Ab- 
solution, and uses the alternative unction following there- 
after in brackets. ‘ : 


HOLY UNCTION 285 


P. By this holy + unction and of His most ten- 
der love, the Lord pardon thee whatever faults thou 
hast committed through touch. R. Amen. 


In cases of extremity, or at the option of the Priest, 
the forehead only need be anointed, with these words: 

P. By this holy + unction and of His most ten- 
der love, the Lord pardon thee whatever faults thou 
hast committed through thy thoughts and desires, 
and the senses of thy body. BR. Amen. 


THE ABSOLUTION 


P. Our Lord Christ, Who hath left power 
on earth to His Church to absolve all those that with 
hearty repentance and true faith turn unto Him, of 
His tender compassion forgive thee thine of- 
fences; and by His authority committed unto me I 
+ absolve thee from all thy sins. In the Name of 
the Father, + and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. 
Amen, 


P. The King of Love and Fountain of all good- 
ness restore unto thee the fellowship of the Holy 
Spirit, and give thee grace to continue in the same, 
that thou mayest inherit the kingdom of heaven and 
be made like unto His own pure and glorious Image. 
R. Amen. 





AN ALTERNATIVE UNCTION 
To be used when the previous unction is omitted. - 
[P. Let us pray. 


O Lord, Who hast given unto man bodily health 
and vigour: wherewith to serve Thee, we pray Thee 
to free Thy servant from his sickness so far as may 
be expedient for him, and by the might of Thy + 
blessing to restore unto him full health, both out- 
wardly in his body and inwardly in his soul. Through 
Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


286 HOLY UNCTION 





The Priest now anoints the patient with the oil for 
the sick upon the forehead, saying: ; 


In the Name of Christ, and invoking the holy Arch- 
angel Raphael, I + anoint thee with oil, that thou 
mayest gain refreshment, both of soul and body. R. 
Amen. 





Whichever form of unction has been used, the Priest 
now proceeds to anoint, in the same manner as before 
but im silence, the seven centres of the body, to wit: 
the sacral plexus (at the base of the spine), the spleen 
(from the back, near the tenth rib on the left side of 
the body), the solar plexus (above the navel), the heart, 
the pharyngeal plexus (at the front of the throat), the 
centre between the eyebrows (unless this has already 
been anointed), and the centre at the top of the head. 


Of these it is sufficient to anoint the last-four or five, 
more especially if the patient’s infirmity be great. 


Lhe Priest then says the following prayer, omitting 
the portion in brackets if it be inappropriate: 


As with this visible oil thy body is outwardly an-. 
ointed, so our heavenly Father, Almighty God, grant) 
of His infinite goodness that thy soul inwardly may! 
be anointed with the Holy Ghost, Who is the Spirit. 
of strength, relief and gladness. And [howsoever 
His goodness shall dispose of thee, whether this. 
world still detain thee in the flesh or the future re- 
ceive thee out of the body,| may He so replenish 
thee with the spirit of His wisdom and strengthen 
thee with His mighty power, that thou mayest per-| 
severe in the way of holiness and ever serve Him | 
joyfully in the course He hath appointed for thee. 
Through Christ our Lord. BR. Amen. 4 


THE BENEDICTION 


P. Christ, the Son of God, look down upon thine| 
affliction, and heal thee of all thine infirmities. May 
the Light of His Love enfold thee for ever.

THE ABSOLUTION 


|The Priest should exhort the dying man to make a 
homentary act of contrition and then to turn with love 
nd devotion to his Master. The Priest immediately

of the Dead.
