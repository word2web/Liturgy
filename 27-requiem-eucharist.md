THE REQUIEM EUCHARIST 


In the Requiem Eucharist violet is the colour used, save 
in the case of children of tender years, when the colour 
is white. In such case also the word ‘‘child’’ is sub- 
stituted for ‘‘servant.’’ — 


The order of service is as usual, except for the points 
hereunder noted. 





THE INVOCATION 


P. In the Name of the Father, » and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 


PSALM 90 
To be used instead of the Canticle. 


Antiphon 
God is our hope and strength. 
A very present help in trouble. 


1. Lord, Thou has been our refuge: from one 
generation to another. 

2. Before the mountains were brought forth, or 
ever the earth and the world were made: Thou art 
God from everlasting, and world without end. 

8. Thou turnest man to destruction: again Thou 
sayest, Come again, ye children of men. 


4, For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as 
yesterday: seeing that is past as a watch in the 
night. 

5. The days of our age are threescore years and 
ten; and though men be so strong that they come to 
fourscore years, yet is their strength then but labour 
and sorrow: so soon passeth it away, and we are 
gone. 

6. So teach us to number our days: that we may 
apply our hearts unto wisdom, 


300 THE REQUIEM EUCHARIST

dren of Thy glory. 

8. And the glorious majesty of the Lord our 
God be upon us: prosper Thou the work of our hands 
upon us, O prosper Thou our handiwork. 


Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to 
the Holy Ghost. 


As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall 
be: world without end. Amen. 


Antiphon 
God is our hope and strength. 
A very present help in trouble.

and let light perpetual shine upon them. 


The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance: 
he shall not be afraid of evil tidings. 


Blessed is the man whom Thou choosest and re- 
ceivest unto Thee: he shall dwell in Thy court, and

even of Thy holy temple. 


Rest in the eternal grant unto them, O Lord: and 
let light perpetual shine upon them. 


THE COLLECTS 


The second and third Collects are as follows: 


Almighty God, Who hast dominion over both the 
living and the dead, and dost hold all Thy creation 
in the everlasting arms of Thy love, we offer this 
Holy Sacrifice that it may avail for the peace 
and repose of Thy servant, and that he, being dead | 
unto this world, yet ever living unto Thee, may find | 
in Thy continued and unceasing service the perfect | 
consummation of happiness and peace. Through 
Christ our Lord, R. Amen. 





THE REQUIEM EUCHARIST 301 


Likewise, O Lord, we pray Thee for those who love 
Thy servant, those whom Thou hast called to sacri- 
fice the solace of his earthly presence: do thou, O 
Lord, comfort them with the balm of Thy lovingkind- 
hess, that, strengthened by Thee and resting upon the 
surety of Thy wisdom, they may put aside their 
thoughts of grief and sorrow; and pour out upon 
him only such thoughts of love as may help him in 
the higher life of service to which Thou hast now 
called him. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


‘THE EPISTLE 


__ The Epistle is taken from the fifteenth chapter of 
the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corin- 
thians, beginning at the fifty-first verse, 

Behold, I show you a mystery; there is a natural 
body, and there is a spiritual body: for this corrup- 
tible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must 
put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall 
have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have 
put on immortality; then shall be brought to pass the 
‘saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in 
victory. O death, where is thy sting? oO grave, 
where is thy victory? But thanks be to God, which 
giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye Steadfast, un- 
movable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, 
forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in 
vain in the Lord. 


: Here endeth the Epistle, 





THE GRADUAL. 


| 1, Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy 
youth: while the evil days come not, nor the years 
draw nigh, when thou shalt Say, I have no pleasure 
in them. 


2. While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the 
tars, be not darkened: nor the clouds return after 
be rain, 


302 THE REQUIEM: EUCHARIST 


3. In the day when the keepers of the _ house 
shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow them- 
selves: and the grinders cease because they are few, 
and those that look out of the windows be darkened. 


4, And the doors shall be shut in the streets, 
when the sound of the grinding is low: and he shall 
rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daugh- 
ters of music shall be brought low. 


5, Also when they shall be afraid of that which 
is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond 
tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a 
burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to 
his long home, and the mourners go about the streets. 


6. Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden 
bowl be broken: or the pitcher be broken at the 
fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. 


7. Then shall the dust return unto the earth as it 
was: and the spirit shall return unto God Who gave 
it. 


The Gospel 


The holy Gospel is taken from the eleventh chaptei 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the twenty 
first verse. a 


Then said Martha unto Jesus: Lord, if Thou hads 
been here, my brother had not died. But I knov 
that even now, whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God 
God will give it Thee. Jesus saith unto her 
Thy brother shall rise again. Martha  saitl 
unto Him: I know that he shall rise again ii 
the resurrection at the last day, Jesus said unt 
her: I am the Resurrection and the Life; he tha 
believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall h 
live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in M 
shall never die. Believest thou this ? She sait' 
unto Him: Yea, Lord; I believe that Thou art th 
Christ, the Son of God, Which should come into th 
world, ay

\ In the case of children, the following Gospel is used: 


The. holy Gospel is taken from the tenth chapter of 
that according to St. Mark, beginning at the thirteenth 
verse. 


And they brought young children to Him, that 
He should touch them; and His disciples rebuked 
those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, 
He was much displeased, and said unto them: Suf- 
fer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid 
them not; for of such is the kingdom of God. Amen,

therein. And He took them up in His arms, put 
His hands upon them, and blessed them. 





COMMUNIO 


The Lord our God liveth for ever and ever: and 
we His children live in Him.

they have no sure stay, and their life lieth in dark-

fear they the shadow of death. 


For He is the Lord of life and death alike: and 
all the worlds are in His Hand.

sionate wisdom which guided Thy child through 
the portal of birth hath now called him through 
death’s gateway to a fuller life with Thee. Enlight-

Thy laws, that casting out all fear he may grow in 
grace, aS he labours in Thy holy service. Through ©
