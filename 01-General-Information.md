GENERAL INFORMATION 


The Liberal Catholic Church exists to forward the 
work of her Master Christ in the world, and to feed His 
flock. It draws the central inspiration of its work 
from an intense faith in the Living Christ, believing 
that the vitality of a Church gains in proportion as its 
members cease to think only of a Christ Who lived 
two thousand years ago, and strive rather to serve as 
a vehicle for the Eternal Christ, Who ever lives as a 
mighty spiritual Presence in the world, guiding and 
sustaining His people. ‘*Lo, I am with you alway, 
even unto the consummation of the age.’’ ‘‘ Before 
Abraham was, I am.’’ 


The Liberal Catholic Church is an independent and 
self-governing body; neither Roman Catholic nor pro- 
testant—but Catholic. It traces its Episcopal Suce- 
cession to the Old Catholic Church of Holland, and 
came into existence as the result of a re-organization 
in 1916 of the Old Catholic Church in Great Britain. 
It aims at combining the traditional sacramental form 
of worship—with its stately ritual, its deep mysticism 
and its abiding witness to the reality of sacramental 
grace—with the widest measure of intellectual liberty 
and respect for the individual conscience. It there- 
fore permits to its members freedom of interpreta- 
tion of the Seriptures, the Creeds and the Liturgy. 
Regarding the mind as one of the great avenues to 
spiritual apprehension, it encourages among its ad- 
herents the freest play of scientific or philosophic 
thought. 


It welcomes to its Altars all who reverently and sin- 
cerely approach them, erecting no barriers in the nature 
ef standards of dogmatic belief. It has no wish 

to proselytize, inthe aggressive sense, from among 
the adherents of any other Church, and as an earnest 
of this welcomes people to regular’ and full partici- 
pation in its services without asking or expecting them 
to leave their original Church. 


The Liberal Catholic Church is a living Christian 
Church—‘‘ modernist,’’ in that it maintains that the 
form of religion should keep pace with human growth 
and enlightenment; ‘‘historic,’’ in that it holds that 
the Church has handed down a very precious heritage 
from the Christ Himself.
