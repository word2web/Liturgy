HOLY ORDERS 


Holy Orders is the Sacrament by which, in their var- 
ious degrees, ministers of the Church receive power and 
authority to perform their sacred duties. Our Lord 
works through human agency, and to the end that those 
who are chosen for this sacred ministry as Bishops, 
Priests or Deacons, shall become readier channels for 
His grace, He has ordained that they shall be linked 
closely with Him by this holy rite, and shall thereby 
be empowered to administer His Sacraments and act’as 
almoners of His blessing. But it is most important 
that the people should remember that they receive all 
Sacraments from the Hand of Christ Himself, and that 
the officiant is but’ an instrument in that Hand. 





There are two groups of Orders in the Christian 
Church—the minor and the major; and there is a pre- 
liminary stage leading up to each group. The minor 
Orders are four, the major three; they may be tabu- 
lated as under.
