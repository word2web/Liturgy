THE ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 


eS 


The Bishop celebrates the Holy Eucharist, at which 
the following special Collect and Epistle are used: 


THE COLLECT 


Almighty, everlasting God, by Whose Spirit the 
whole body of the Church is made holy and govern- 
ed, do Thou pour forth Thy sanctifying grace into 
the hearts of these Thy Servants, who are about to 
be numbered among the Priests of Thy Church, that 
with pure heart and open mind they may faithfully 
receive Thy blessing from on high. Through Christ 
our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Collect of the Day and the Collect for Peace fol- 
low here. 


THE EPISTLE 


The Epistle is taken from the fifth chapter of 
the First Epistle General of St. Peter, beginning at the 
first verse. 


The elders which are among you I exhort, who am 
also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of 
Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall 
be revealed: Feed the flock of God which is among 
you, taking the oversight thereof not by constraint, 
but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready 
mind; neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but 
being ensamples to the flock. And when the chief 
Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of 
glory that fadeth not away. The God of all grace, 
Who hath called us unto His eternal glory by Christ 
Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you 
perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. To Him 
be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen, 


Here endeth the Epistle. 


338 ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 


The Gradual being ended, the Bishop takes his seat 
upon a faldstool before the Altar. The ordinands come 
forward bearing lighted candles, and a Priest appointed ~ 
for the purpose presents them to the Bishop, saying: 


Right Reverend Father, our holy Mother the 
Church catholic prays that you would ordain these 
Deacons here present to the charge of the Priest- 
hood. 


Bishop. Knowest thou them to be worthy ? 


Pp, As far as human frailty allows me to judge, 
I do both know and attest that they are worthy of 
the charge of this office. 


B. Thanks be to God. 


The ordinands are then seated, and the Bishop charges 
the clergy and people as follows: : 


Dearly beloved brethren, as both the captain of a 
ship and the passengers it carries have equal cause 
for security or for fear, it behoves them whose in- 
terests are common to be of one mind. Nor was it 
without purpose that the Fathers decreed that the 
people also should be consulted touching the election 
of those who are to be employed in the service of 
the Altar, for what is unknown of the many con- 
cerning the life and conversation of those who are 
presented, may oft-times be known to a few, and 
all will necessarily yield a more ready obedience to 
one when ordained, to whose ordination they have 
signified their assent. If, then, any one has aught 
to the prejudice of these men, in the Name of God 
and for the benefit of His Church, let him boldly 
come forward and speak; howbeit, let him be mind- 
ful of his own estate. : 


After a pause, the Bishop, addressing himself to the 
ordinands, charges them as follows: 


Dearly beloved sons, it is now our part solemnly 
and for the last time, before the irrevocable act shall 
be accomplished which shall lay upon you the sweet 





ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 339 


but heavy burden of the Priesthood, to charge you 
\how great is the dignity and responsibility of this 
office and how weighty are the duties to be performed 
by those ordained thereto. It appertains to the 
Priest to offer sacrifice, to bless, to preside, to loose 
and to bind, to anoint, to preach and to baptize. 
Wherefore, dearly beloved sons, whom the award 
of our brethren has chosen that you may be conse- 
crated to this office as our helpers, after solemn pre- 
meditation only and with great awe is so sublime an 
office to be approached, and great indeed must be the 
care with which we determine that they who are 
chosen to represent our Blessed Lord and to preside 
in His Church commend themselves by great wisdom, 
by worthiness of life and the persevering practice of 
justice and truth. Do you, then, dearly beloved 
sons, keep these things in remembrance and let the 
fruit thereof be seen in your walk and conversa- 
tion, in chaste and holy integrity of life, in con- 
tinually abounding in all manner of good works. 
Strive without ceasing to increase within yourselves 
the perfection of heavenly love, that having your 
hearts filled with the love of God and of man, you 
may be almoners of Christ’s blessing and bearers of 
His love to the hearts of mankind. Forget never how 
great a privilege is yours to bring the little ones to 
Him through the gateway of baptism and to lift 
the heavy burden of the sorrow and sin of the world 
by the grace of absolution. Consider attentively 
what you do, imitate those things which in the 
Church of God it is your duty to handle and to 
transact. And forasmuch as you will now be called 
upon to offer the Holy Sacrifice before the throne 
of God, and to celebrate the sacred mysteries of the 
Lord’s love, be earnest in ridding your members 
of all imperfections. Ye whose duty it is to offer 
unto God the sweet incense of prayer and adoration, 
let your teaching be a spiritual remedy unto God’s 
people; let your words of blessing and consolation 
be their help and strength; let the sweet savour of 
your life be a fragance in the Church of God,

340 ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 





Thus both by word and deed may you fashion the 
temple of God, so that neither shall we appear blame- 
worthy before the Lord, who in His Name shall thus 
advance you, nor ye who shall thus be advanced; but 
rather may we all find acceptance and abundant recom- 
pense for this day’s act, which of His infinite good- 
ness and lovingkindness may He deign to grant. 


The ordinands rise. 


B. Will you thus strive to use worthily the powers 
entrusted to you ? 


Ordinands. I will. 


B. The Lord keep you in all these things, well- 
beloved sons, and strengthen you in all goodness. 
R. Amen. 


The Bishop rises and addresses the people as follows: 


Let us pray, dearest brethren, that Almighty God, 
in His great lovingkindness and watchful care over 
His Church, may bestow a plentiful grace on these 
Deacons, now about to be raised to the Order of the 
Priesthood. 


LITANY 


Should the Diaconate have been conferred during this 
same service, this Litany will already have been sung, 
and will not therefore be repeated. 





All kneel and sing the following Litany, during which 
the ordinands lie prostrate. 





God the Father, seen of none, 

God the co-eternal Son, 

God the Spirit, with Them One, 
Hear us, Holy Trinity. 





ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 341 


God Eternal, mighty King, 

Unto Thee our love we bring; 

Through the world Thy praises ring; 
We are Thine, O Trinity. 


Christ, the Lord of Life and Light, 
Ruler of the starry height, 
Fount of glory infinite, 

Thee we worship, Master. 


Mighty Lord, we hail Thee here, 

Recognize Thy Presence dear, 

Feel and know that Thou art near, 
Keeping thus Thy promise. 


Though Thy Face we cannot see 

As of old in Galilee, 

Strong in faith we worship Thee, | 
Ever-present Master. 


From our fathers we have heard 
Of the gift Thy Hand conferred; 
We have proved Thy holy word; 

Be that gift outpoured. 


Though Thy form from earth hath gone, 
Thine Apostles handed on 
Sacramental benison; 

Be that blessing with us. 


' We this power would now convey, 

Strengthen Thou our hands, we pray, 

Pour Thy might through us to-day, 
Hear us, Holy Master, 


Monarch, at Thy Feet we kneel, 

For Thy servants we appeal, 

Fill their Hearts with holy zeal, 
In Thy service, Master. 


342 ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 


Thou of holy Church the Head, 

Mystic power upon them shed, 

By Thy love may they be led; 
Hear us, Holy Master. 


Link in mystic bond with Thee 
These Thy Priests that they may be 
From the world and self set free, 

By Thy power, O Master. 


May they stand before Thy Face 
Filled with love and heavenly grace; 
Grant them with Thy saints a place 

Near Thee, Lord and Master. 


The three verses which follow are sung by the Bishop 
only : 


We beseech Thee, hear our prayer; 
Bless + Thy servants prostrate there; . 
Hold them in Thy loving care; 

Hear us, Holy Trinity. 


Hear Thy servants as they pray; 

Help Thy chosen Priests to-day. 

Bless + and + hallow them for aye; 
Hear us, Holy Trinity. 


Pour Thy lovingkindness great 

On each chosen candidate; 

Bless + them, + hallow, + consecrate, 
Hear us, Holy Trinity. 


The following verse is sung by all: 


God the Father, seen of none, 
God the co-eternal Son, 
God the Spirit, with Them One, 
We are Thine, O Trinity. 


After the Litany the people are seated. The Bishop 
rises and, with hands extended towards the ordinands, 
who kneel before him, says the following prayer: 





ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 343 


O Lord Christ, the Fountain of all goodness, Who 
by the operation of the Holy Spirit hast appointed 
divers Orders in Thy Church, and for its greater 
enrichment and perfecting dost shed Thy gifts 
abundantly upon men, do Thou pour forth Thy sanc- 
tifying grace upon these Thy servants, who are about 
to be numbered among the Priests of Thy Church. 
May their hands be strong to achieve, may wisdom 
guide and direct their lives, may the beauty of holi- 
ness sanctify them and shed a spiritual fragrance 
about their path, so that in all their works begun, 
continued and ended in Thee, they may show forth 
the abundance of Thy power and glorify Thy holy 
Name, O Thou great King of Love, to Whom be 
praise and adoration from men and from the Angel 
host. BR. Amen. 


In silence the Bishop lays both hands on the head of 
each ordinand. The same is done after him successive- 
ly by all the Priests present. When this is over, both 
the Bishop and the Priests having their right hands ea- 
tended towards the ordinands, the Bishop says the follow- 
ing: 

O Lord Christ, Whose strength is in the silence, 
grant that these Thy servants whom now Thou dost 
join unto Thyself in the holy bond of the Priesthood 
may henceforward minister faithfully of the priestly 
power to those who ask in Thy Name. R. Amen. 


B. Let us pray, dearest brethren, that Almighty 
God may multiply the gifts of the Spirit in these His ~ 
servants for the work of the Priesthood. 


They lower their hands, and all kneel while the 
Veni Creator is sung: 


VENI CREATOR 


Come, Thou Creator Spirit blest, 

And in our souls take up Thy rest; 
Come with Thy grace and heavenly aid, 
To fill the hearts which Thou hast made. 


344 


ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 


Great Paraclete, to Thee we cry, 

O highest gift of God most high; 
O living Fount, O Fire, O Love, 
And sweet anointing from above. 


Thou in Thy sevenfold gifts art known; 
Thee, Finger of God’s Hand, we own, 
The promise of the Father, Thou 

Who dost the tongue with power endow. 


Kindle our senses from above, 

And make our hearts o’erflow with love; 
With patience firm and virtue high 

The weakness of our flesh supply. 


Far let us drive our tempting foe, 
And Thine abiding peace bestow; 
So shall we not, with Thee for guide, 
Turn from the path of life aside. 


O may Thy grace on us bestow 

The Father and the Son to know, 

And Thee, through endless time confessed, 
Of both eternal Spirit blest, 


All glory while the ages run - 

Be to the Father and the Son, 

Who gave us life; the same to Thee, 
O Holy Ghost, eternally. Amen. 


The Bishop rises and again imposes his hands upon 


the 


head of each ordinand, saying to each: 


Receive the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a 
Priest in the Church of God; whose sins thou dost for- 
give, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou dost 
retain, they are retained. 


The Bishop, with his hands extended towards the or- 
dinands, continues: 

O God, the Source of all holiness, of Whom are true 
consecration and the fullness of spiritual benediction, 


ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 345 


we pray Thee, O Lord, to + open to Thy heavenly 
grace the hearts and minds of these Thy servants, 
who have been raised to the Priesthood, that through 
them Thy power may abundantly flew for the service 
of Thy people. May they be earnest and zealous 
as fellow-workers in our Order, and thus prove them- 
selves worthy of the sacred charge committed unto 
them. And, as by a spotless blessing they now 
shall change for the service of Thy people bread and 
wine into the most holy Body and Blood of Thy 
Son, may they be ever watchful that they keep the 
vessel of their ministry pure and undefiled. May 
every kind of righteousness spring forth within them, 
and may their hearts be so filled with compassion 
for the multitude, that they may forget themselves 
in the love of others. Thus steadfast in that Thy 
most joyous service, may the radiance of Thy love 
and Thy glory shine ever more brightly in their 
hearts, till they rise unto mature spiritual manhood, 
unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of 
Christ, when their lives shall be hid with Christ in 
God. R. Amen. 


The Bishop is seated, and, taking the stole that 
hangs after the manner of a Deacon, places it on 
the right shoulder and crosses it over the breast of each 
new Priest, saying: 





Take thou this stole, for a symbol of the power 
of the priestly office, and as a channel of the ever- 
flowing stream of Christ’s love. 


He vests each new Priest with the chasuble, saying: 


Take thou the priestly vestment, that in it thou 
mayest offer with our Lord Christ the most holy 
Sacrifice of His sacred Body and Blood. 


The Bishop anoints the hands of each new Priest 
with the holy oil of the catechuwmens, saying: 


Be pleased, O Lord, to consecrate and hallow these 
hands by this anointing and our + blessing; that 


346 ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 


- whatsoever they + bless may be blessed, and what- 
soever they consecrate may be consecrated and hal- 
lowed, in the Name of our Lord Christ. R. Amen. 


The Bishop closes the hands together, palm to 
palm, and they are bound together with a white linen 
strip» The Bishop delivers to each new Priest a 
chalice containing wine and water, with a paten and a 
host upon it, saying: 

Take thou authority to offer sacrifice to God, and 
to celebrate the Holy Eucharist both for the living 
and for the dead. In the Name of the Lord. R. 
Amen, 


The Bishop and the Priests cleanse their hands. The 
Celebration is continued, one of the newly ordained 
Priests going to the Altar and reading the Gospel as 
follows: 

THE GOSPEL 


The holy Gospel is taken from the twentieth chapter 
of that according to St. John, beginning at the nine- 
teenth verse, and from the twenty-eighth chapter of that 
according to St. Matthew, beginning at the eighteenth — 
verse. 


The same day at evening, being the first day of the 
week, when the doors were shut where the disciples 
were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus, and 
stood in the midst, and saith unto them: Peace be 
unto you. Then were the disciples glad, when they 
saw the Lord. Then said Jesus unto them again: 
Peace be unto you; as my Father hath sent me, even 
so send I you. And when He had said this, He 
breathed on them, and saith unto them: Receive 
ye the Holy Ghost. Whosesoever sins ye remit, 
they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins 
ye retain, they are retained. 


Jesus spake unto them, saying: All power is given 
unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore 
and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of 
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, 


oes ee 


ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 347 





teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I 
have commanded you; and lo, I am with you alway, 
even unto the consummation of the age. 


Just before the Offertorium, the new Priests kneel 
before the Bishop and each presents to him a lighted 
candle as a visible token of gratitude for the gift re- 
cewwed and of the sacrifice of their lives for Christ’s 
work. Thereafter the new Priests recite with the Bishop 
the remainder of the Holy Eucharist, word for word, tak- 
ing particular care to say simultaneously with him the 
Words of Consecration with due intention to consecrate. 





IN THE PRAYER OF CONSECRATION. 


In the Prayer of Consecration the following clause is 
added after the words: ‘‘for all our Bishops, clergy 
and faithful’’: 

Especially for these whom in Christ’s holy Name 
we have admitted to the Order of the Priesthood. 





After the sentence, ‘‘Under the veil of earthly things, 
etc.,’’ the Bishop is once more seated on the faldstool; 
the new Priests kneel before him, and placing each his 
joined hands between those of the Bishop, take an oath 
of canonical obedience: 

B. Dost thou promise to myself and my succes- 
sors due reverence and obedience in matters canoni- 
cal ? isan 


New Priest. I do promise. 


If the Bishop who is ordaining be not the Ordinary, 
he substitutes the name of the latter for the word ‘‘my- 
Self,”? and ““his,’” for <“my,’’ 


B. Peace be to thee. 
N:P. And with thy spirit. 


348 ORDINATION OF PRIESTS 


The Bishop charges them thus: 


Dearly beloved sons, as what you have to 
handle is not without its mischances, I warn you that 
you do most diligently attend to the course of the 
Holy Eucharist, and especially to that which regards 
the consecration, the breaking and communion of the 
Host. Be you also careful that in everything which 
appertains to the administration of the Sacraments 
of Christ’s holy Church, you do adhere to the form 
set forth by lawful authority, and presume not to 
depart therefrom in any detail. 


He blesses the new Priests kneeling before him, 
as follows: 2 


The blessing of God Almighty, the + Father, the 
+ Son, and the Holy + Ghost, come down upon you, 
that you may be blessed in the priestly Order, and 
in the offering of sacrifice to Almighty God,.to Whom 
belong honour and glory to the ages of ages. R. Amen. 


The Bishop is again seated upon the faldstool, and ad- 
dresses the new Priests as follows: 


Dearly beloved sons, consider attentively the Order 
you have taken and be ever mindful of. the sacred 
trust reposed in you. Since it hath pleased our 
Lord to call you thus closer to Himself, forget not 
the service of your brethren, which is the golden 
pathway to His most glorious Presence. Freely ye 
have received, freely give. 


The Communio is sung, and the Holy Eucharist is 
continued to its close.
