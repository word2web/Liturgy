HOLY BAPTISM 


Baptism is a Sacrament by which the recipient is 
solemnly admitted to membership of Christ’s holy Church 
and ‘‘grafted into His mystical body.”? 


The Exorcism is intended to deaden the germs of 
evil in infants, or to effect a preliminary purification 
in those more advanced in years. 


The first Anointing is, as indicated, for the strength- 
ening and safeguarding of the candidate, and is fol- 
lowed immediately by the Baptism in the Name of the 
Trinity, and then by the second Anointing with holy 
chrism, still further to strengthen him. 

Where there is doubt about the validity or complete- 
ness of a former Baptism, the Sacrament is re-adminis- 
tered conditionally. 

The pouring of the water symbolizes both the wash- 
ing away of sin and the downpouring of power from 
on high. The font is usually placed near the entrance 
of the church to show that by Baptism we gain admis- 
sion to the Church of God. 


So far as is convenient, holy Baptism should be ad- 
ministered publicly in the presence of a congregation. 





FORM TO BE USED FOR INFANTS 


Instructions to Parents 
The head of the child should be uncovered, and the 
~ “dress somerranged that the oil of catechumens can be

white silk handkerchieéi, »resented by the godparents.

father and godmother, who ‘ay the words of presenta- 
tion respectively, according towhether the child be male

P. Brethren, our fair Father Christ, in His great 
lovingkindness, hath ordained that His mystic Bride,

dwell in a body purified from the taint of evil, sanc- 
tified and set apart for the service of Almighty God.

Therefore, brethren of Christ’s catholic Church, I 
pray you to join with me in this our holy rite, where- 
by this*child shall be made partaker of these heaven. 
ly gifts and a member of His mystical body. 


Hear the words of the Gospel written by St. Mark, 
in the tenth chapter, at the thirteenth verse. 


They brought young children to Christ, that He 
should touch them; and His disciples rebuked those 
that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, He 
was much displeased, and said unto them: Suffer 
the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them 
not; for of such is the kingdom of God. Amen, I 
say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the king- 
dom of God as a little child, he shall not enter there- 
in. And He took them up in His arms, put His 
hands upon them, and blessed them. 


The Priest places his right hand on the head of 
the child, and says: 


240 BAPTISM OF INFANTS 





Let us pray. 

O God, Omnipotent and Omnipresent, Whose power 
worketh in every living creature, Who alone art the 
source of all life and goodness, deign to shed upon 
this Thy servant, who has been called to the rudiments 
of the faith, a ray of Thy light; drive out from him 
all blindness of heart, break all the chains of iniquity 
wherewith he has been bound; open to him, O Lord, 
the gate of Thy glory, that being replenished with 
the spirit of Thy wisdom and strengthened by Thy 
mighty power, le may be free from the taint of evil 
desire, and steadfastly advancing in holiness may 
joyfully serve Thee in the course Thou hast appoint- 
ed for him. Through Christ our Lord. BR. Amen. 


THE EXORCISM 


P. In the Name which is above every name, in 
the power of the + Father, and of the + Son, and 
of the Holy + Ghost, I exorcize all influences and 
seeds of evil; I lay upon them the spell of Christ’s 
holy Church, that they may be bound fast as with 
iron chains and cast into outer darkness, that they 
trouble not this servant of God; 


He again places his hand on the head of the child. 


for He Who is the Lord of Love and Compassion 
hath deigned to call him to His holy grace and 
blessing and to the font of Baptism. 


The Priest then proceeds as follows: 
Ephphatha: that is, Be thou opened. 


Here the Priest makes the sign of the cross over the 
brow, the throat, the heart, and the navel of the child. 


Let thy mind and thy heart be opened to the most 
holy Spirit of the living God, that thy whole nature 
may be dedicated for ever to His service; so mayest 
thou have power to receive the heavenly precepts 
and to be such in thy conduct that thou mayest be 
a pure temple of the living God.

cate to Thy service, that, using well the beginnings 
of Thy glory and heedfully observing Thy holy laws, 
he may be found worthy to attain to the fullness 
of the new birth. Through Christ our Lord. R.

have part with Christ unto life eternal.

behind the child, reaching to the entire length of the

gels, that thy life may be filled with His peace.

THE CHARGE TO SPONSORS 

P. Ye who have brought this child here to be bap- 
tized, seeing that now he is regenerate of water and 
the Holy Spirit, and grafted into the mystical body 
of Christ’s Church, remember that there lies upon 
you a duty not lightly to be cast aside. It is your 
part to see that so soon as he is old enough to under- 
stand, he is taught God’s holy will and command- 
ment, as it was spoken by our Lord Himself when 
He said: ‘‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with 
all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy 
mind and with all thy strength. This is the first 
and great commandment; and the second is like unto 
it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On 
these two commandments hang all the law and the 
prophets.’’ 

Also he shall be taught the doctrine of the holy 
catholic Church, into which he has this day been ad- 
mitted, and shall be brought in due course before the 
Bishop to be confirmed by him.

stand the service.

God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And 
He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon 
them, and blessed them. 


The Priest places his right hand on the head of the 
child, and says:

er worketh in every living creature, Who alone art 
the source of all life and goodness, deign to shed 
upon this Thy servant, who has been called to the 
rudiments of the faith, a ray of Thy light: drive 
out from him all blindness of heart, break all the 
chains of iniquity wherewith he has been bound; open 
to him, O Lord, the gate of Thy glory, that, -being 
replenished with the spirit of Thy wisdom and 
strengthened by Thy mighty power, he may be free 
from the taint of evil desire, and steadfastly advanc- 
ing in holiness may joyfully serve Thee in the course 
Thou hast appointed for him.’ Through Christ our 
Lord. R. Amen.]
