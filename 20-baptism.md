# Holy Baptism

Baptism is a Sacrament by which the recipient is solemnly admitted to membership of Christ's holy Church and "grafted into His mystical body."

The Exorcism is intended to deaden the germs of evil in infants, or to effect a preliminary purification in those more advanced in years.

The first Anointing is, as indicated, for the strengthening and safeguarding of the candidate, and is followed immediately by the Baptism in the Name of the Trinity, and then by the second Anointing with holy chrism, still further to strengthen him.

Where there is doubt about the validity or completeness of a former Baptism, the Sacrament is re-administered *sub conditione* (conditionally).

The pouring of the water symbolizes both the washing away of sin and the downpouring of power from on high. The font is usually placed near the entrance of the church to show that by Baptism we gain admission to the Church of God.

So far as is convenient, holy Baptism should be administered publicly in the presence of a congregation.

## Form to Be Used for Infants

### Instructions to Parents and Godparents

*The head of the child should be uncovered, and the dress so arranged that the oil of catechumens can be applied on the breast or throat and at the nape of the neck behind.*

*It is customary that the "white vesture" shall be a white silk handkerchief, presented by the godparents. This is to be blessed by the Priest and retained by the child in memory of his Baptism.*

*For each child to be baptized there should be a godfather and godmother, who say the words of presentation respectively, according to whether the child be male or female.*

---

### The Invocation

**P.** In the Name of the Father, † and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  
**R.** Amen.

---

### The Presentation

*Sponsor:* Reverend Father, we present to you this child, praying that you will receive him into the fellowship of Christ's Church.

**P.** Brethren, our dear Father Christ, in His great lovingkindness, hath ordained that His mystic Bride, our holy Mother the Church, shall guide and protect her children at every stage from the cradle to the grave. To this end is the Sacrament of holy Baptism ordained, that in His Name the Church may give welcome and blessing to him who is newly come into this world of pilgrimage, and that the soul may dwell in a body purified from the taint of evil, sanctified and set apart for the service of Almighty God.

*Addressing the sponsors and congregation:*

Therefore, brethren of Christ's catholic Church, I pray you to join with me in this our holy rite, whereby this child shall be made partaker of these heavenly gifts and a member of His mystical body.

Hear the words of the Gospel written by St. Mark, in the tenth chapter, at the thirteenth verse:

> They brought young children to Christ, that He should touch them; and His disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, He was much displeased, and said unto them: Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God. Amen, I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed them.

*The Priest places his right hand on the head of the child, and says:*

Let us pray.

> O God, Omnipotent and Omnipresent, Whose power worketh in every living creature, Who alone art the source of all life and goodness, deign to shed upon this Thy servant, who has been called to the rudiments of the faith, a ray of Thy light; drive out from him all blindness of heart, break all the chains of iniquity wherewith he has been bound; open to him, O Lord, the gate of Thy glory, that being replenished with the spirit of Thy wisdom and strengthened by Thy mighty power, he may be free from the taint of evil desire, and steadfastly advancing in holiness may joyfully serve Thee in the course Thou hast appointed for him. Through Christ our Lord.  
> **R.** Amen.

### The Exorcism

**P.** In the Name which is above every name, in the power of the † Father, and of the † Son, and of the Holy † Ghost, I exorcize all influences and seeds of evil; I lay upon them the spell of Christ's holy Church, that they may be bound fast as with iron chains and cast into outer darkness, that they trouble not this servant of God;

*He again places his hand on the head of the child.*

for He Who is the Lord of Love and Compassion hath deigned to call him to His holy grace and blessing and to the font of Baptism.

*The Priest then proceeds as follows:*

**Ephphatha:** that is, *Be thou opened.*

*Here the Priest makes the sign of the cross over the brow, the throat, the heart, and the navel of the child.*

Let thy mind and thy heart be opened to the most holy Spirit of the living God, that thy whole nature may be dedicated for ever to His service; so mayest thou have power to receive the heavenly precepts and to be such in thy conduct that thou mayest be a pure temple of the living God.

*He stretches out his right hand towards the child, and says:*

Do Thou, O Lord, with Thy ever-abiding power, watch over this Thy chosen servant, whom we dedicate to Thy service, that, using well the beginnings of Thy glory and heedfully observing Thy holy laws, he may be found worthy to attain to the fullness of the new birth. Through Christ our Lord.  
**R.** Amen.

*The Priest places the end of his stole upon the child's shoulder, and says:*

Come into the temple of God, that thou mayest have part with Christ unto life eternal.

---

### The First Anointing

*The Priest takes upon his right thumb a little of the oil of catechumens. At the first two crosses the Priest touches respectively the child's breast or throat and the nape of his neck, making a small cross at each with the oil; he then makes two crosses respectively before and behind the child, reaching to the entire length of the body.*

**P.** In the Name of Christ our Lord, I † anoint thee with oil for thy safeguarding; may His holy Angel † go before thee, and † follow after thee; may he be with thee in thy downsitting and thine uprising and keep thee in all thy ways.

---

### The Baptism

*While the godparents hold the child over the font, the Priest pours some of the consecrated baptismal water over the head and forehead of the child thrice. At the same time he pronounces the words:*

**N.,** I baptize thee in the Name of the † Father, and of the † Son, and of the Holy † Ghost. Amen.

> *If the Baptism be sub conditione the formula to be used is found in the form of Baptism for Children.*

---

### The Anointing with Chrism

*The Priest takes upon his thumb some of the sacred chrism, and, anointing the child on the top of the head in the form of a cross, says:*

With Christ's holy chrism do I † anoint thee, that His strength may prevent thee in thy going out and thy coming in, and may guide thee into life everlasting.

---

### The Reception

*With his thumb, still moist with chrism, the Priest makes a cross upon the child's brow; at the last clause he lays his hand upon the infant's head.*

**P.** I receive this child into the fellowship of Christ's holy Church and do † sign him with the sign of the cross in token that hereafter he shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ our Lord, to acknowledge Him when He shall come, and manfully to fight under His banner against sin and selfishness, and that he shall continue Christ's faithful soldier and servant throughout the ages of ages.  
**R.** Amen.

*A white silk handkerchief is brought, and the Priest, having blessed it, places it upon the shoulders of the child, saying:*

Receive from holy Church this white vesture as a pattern of the spotless purity and brightness of Him Whose service thou hast entered to-day, and for a token of thy fellowship with Christ and His holy Angels, that thy life may be filled with His peace.

*Delivering a lighted candle to the child, the Priest says:*

Take this burning light, enkindled from the fire of God's holy Altar, for a sign of the ever-burning light of thy spirit. God grant that hereafter His love shall so shine through thy heart that thou mayest continually enlighten the lives of thy fellow-men.

*The Priest places his hand on the head of the child, saying:*

**N.,** Go in peace, and may the Lord be with thee.  
**R.** Amen.

---

### The Charge to Sponsors

**P.** Ye who have brought this child here to be baptized, seeing that now he is regenerate of water and the Holy Spirit, and grafted into the mystical body of Christ's Church, remember that there lies upon you a duty not lightly to be cast aside. It is your part to see that so soon as he is old enough to understand, he is taught God's holy will and commandment, as it was spoken by our Lord Himself when He said: *"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength. This is the first and great commandment; and the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."*

Also he shall be taught the doctrine of the holy catholic Church, into which he has this day been admitted, and shall be brought in due course before the Bishop to be confirmed by him.

## Form to Be Used for Children

## Notes on Practice

- The phrase *"prevent thee"* is used in its archaic liturgical sense, meaning *"to go before and protect,"* not the modern sense of hindering.
- *"Sub conditione"* (conditional baptism) is administered when there is reasonable doubt concerning the validity or completeness of a previous baptism.
- The white vesture and lighted candle are traditional symbols of purity and the light of Christ; their use may be adapted according to local custom.
- The term *"catholic"* (with a lowercase 'c') refers to the universal Church, not specifically to the Roman Catholic communion.
