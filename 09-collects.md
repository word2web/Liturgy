Advent Sunday

The Collect
O Christ our Lord, we pray for strength to cast away the works of darkness and put upon us the armour of light, that we may prepare ourselves not only to keep aright Thy holy Feast of Christmas, but also faithfully and acceptably to serve Thee when Thou shalt come again, to Whom we ever offer heartfelt love and worship. R. Amen.

This Collect is to be repeated every day, after the Collect appointed for the day, until Christmas Eve.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the thirteenth chapter of that of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans, beginning at the first verse.

LET every soul be subject unto the higher powers; for there is no power but of God, and the powers that be are ordained of God. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; honour to whom honour. Owe no man anything, but to love one another; for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in strife and envying; for none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. Let not then your good be evil spoken of, but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ; for the kingdom of God is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-first chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the twenty-seventh verse.

THEN shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. When these things begin to come to pass, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.

And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and with the cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. Watch ye therefore, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.

In your patience possess ye your souls; heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.

Second Sunday in Advent
The Collect
O God, Creator and Preserver of mankind, we thank Thee for Thy never-failing love, and do most earnestly desire and resolve to show forth Thy praise not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to Thy service, and by walking before Thee in holiness and righteousness all our days, through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the fifth chapter of the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians, beginning at the eleventh verse.

WHEREFORE comfort yourselves together and edify one another, and be at peace among yourselves. We exhort you, brethren, warn them which are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. See that none render evil for evil unto any man, but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves and to all men. Rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the Spirit; prove all things; hold fast that which is good, and abstain from all appearance of evil.

And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the fourth chapter of that according to St. Mark, beginning at the twenty-fourth verse.

TAKE heed what ye hear; with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you; and unto you that hear shall more be given. For he that hath, to him shall be given; and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.

So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself: first the blade, then the ear, and after that the full corn in the ear. But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.

Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what comparison shall we compare it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth; but when it is sown it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.

Third Sunday in Advent
The Collect
Grant us, O Lord, so to prepare and make ready Thy way, by turning the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, that when Thou shalt come to teach the world, the ground may be found fit for Thy sowing, Thou Who art the Teacher alike of Angels and of men. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle is taken from the first chapter of the Book of the Prophet Malachi, beginning at the eleventh verse.

FROM the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same My Name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered unto My Name and a pure offering.

Behold, I will send My messenger, and he shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord Whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in; behold, He shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts. But who may abide the day of His coming; and who shall stand when He appeareth? For He is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap. And He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord; and they shall be Mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the first chapter of that according to St. Mark, beginning at the first verse.

THE beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God; as it is written in the prophets: Behold, I send my messenger before Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way before Thee; the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight. John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. And there went out unto him all the land of Judæa, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; and preached, saying: There cometh after me One mightier than I, the latchet of Whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. I indeed have baptized you with water, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.

Fourth Sunday in Advent
The Collect
Almighty everliving God, we pray Thee to inspire continually Thy universal Church with the spirit of truth, unity and concord, that all they who do confess Thy holy Name may agree in the truth of Thy holy Word, and live in unity and godly love, through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the twelfth chapter of the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians, beginning at the twelfth verse.

AS the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many; and the eye cannot say unto the hand: I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you. There should be no schism in the body, but the members should have the same care one for another. And where one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the thirteenth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the third verse.

JESUS, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He was come from God, and went to God, riseth from supper, and laid aside His garments; and took a towel, and girded Himself. After that He poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded. So after He had washed their feet, and had taken His garments, and was set down again, He said unto them: Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call Me Master and Lord; and ye say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.

Amen, Amen, I say unto you: The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. Amen, Amen, I say unto you: He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth Me; and he that receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me. A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another.

Christmas Day
The Nativity of Our Lord

The Collect
Most dear and holy Lord, we praise Thee, we bless Thee, with all our hearts do we thank and glorify Thee for this Thy wondrous Feast of Christmas, praying Thee that as Thou wast born on earth as at this time for us, so mayest Thou be born and reign forevermore within the hearts of men, Who with the Father and the Holy Spirit art one God throughout all ages of ages. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle is taken from the seventh chapter of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, beginning at the fourteenth verse.

THE Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a Virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call His Name Emmanuel. And it shall be said: The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. They joy before Thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His Name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the second chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the first verse.

IT came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. And all went to be enrolled, everyone into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, into the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he was of the house and lineage of David) to be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was that, while they were there, her days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped Him in swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.

And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the Angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the Angel said unto them: Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men.

The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for every day after until Compline on New Year’s Eve, unless otherwise ordered.

New Year’s Day
The Collect
Almighty God, who hast brought us in safety to the beginning of this year, we humbly beseech Thee that as Thou dost enable us to begin anew the course of our earthly life, so Thou wouldst graciously grant us to spend the days of our lives in Thy holy fear and service, and at last attain everlasting joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

This Collect may be used daily throughout the Octave of the New Year.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the fourth chapter of the Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to Titus, beginning at the fourth verse.

WHEN the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that being justified by His grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the fifteenth chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the thirteenth verse.

JESUS answered and said unto them: Every plant which My heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

But He answered and said: It is not meet to take the children’s bread and to cast it to dogs. And she said: Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table. Then Jesus answered and said unto her: O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.

The Second Sunday after Christmas
The Collect
O God, Who didst wonderfully create and yet more wonderfully restore the dignity of human nature, grant that we may share in the divine life of Him who humbled Himself to share our humanity, even Jesus Christ Thy Son our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, world without end. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the first chapter of the First Epistle of St. John, beginning at the first verse.

THAT which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life—for the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us—that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the first chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the first verse.

IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.

There was a man sent from God whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His Name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.

The Circumcision of Christ
(January 1st)

Note: In some traditions, the Feast of the Circumcision coincides with New Year’s Day. Where observed separately, the following may be used.

The Collect
Almighty God, who madest Thy blessed Son to be circumcised and obedient to the Law for our sake, grant us the true circumcision of the Spirit, that our hearts and all our members may be mortified from all worldly and carnal lusts, and we may in all things obey Thy blessed will; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the second chapter of the Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans, beginning at the twenty-fifth verse.

CIRCUMCISION verily profiteth if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? And shall not uncircumcision which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men but of God.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the second chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the twenty-first verse.

AND when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the Child, His Name was called JESUS, which was so named of the Angel before He was conceived in the womb.

The Epiphany of Our Lord
(January 6th)

The Collect
O God, who by the leading of a star didst manifest Thine only-begotten Son to the Gentiles, mercifully grant that we, who know Thee now by faith, may after this life enjoy the fulness of Thy glorious Godhead; through Jesus Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

This Collect is to be repeated every day with that of the Sunday or other Feast until the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the third chapter of the Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians, beginning at the second verse.

IF ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: how that by revelation He made known unto me the mystery (as I wrote afore in few words, whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ), which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ by the gospel.

Of this gospel I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of His power. Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the second chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the first verse.

NOW when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem, saying: Where is He that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and are come to worship Him. When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him: In Bethlehem of Judæa; for thus it is written by the prophet:

“And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda; for out of thee shall come a Governor that shall rule My people Israel.”

Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said: Go and search diligently for the young Child; and when ye have found Him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship Him also.

When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young Child was. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshipped Him; and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him gifts: gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.

And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

The First Sunday after Epiphany
(The Baptism of Our Lord)

The Collect
O God, whose blessed Son was manifested that He might destroy the works of the devil and make us the children of God and heirs of eternal life, grant us, we beseech Thee, that, having this hope, we may purify ourselves even as He is pure; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the third chapter of the First Epistle of St. John, beginning at the first verse.

BEHOLD what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God! Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure. Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not; whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him. Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the third chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the fifteenth verse.

AND as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John whether he were the Christ or not, John answered, saying unto them all: I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.

Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from heaven which said: Thou art My beloved Son; in Thee I am well pleased.

The Second Sunday after Epiphany
The Collect
Almighty and everlasting God, who dost govern all things in heaven and earth, mercifully hear the supplications of Thy people, and grant us Thy peace all the days of our life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the twelfth chapter of the Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans, beginning at the first verse.

I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.

Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation; he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the second chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the first verse.

AND the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there. And both Jesus was called, and His disciples, to the marriage. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto Him: They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her: Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.

His mother saith unto the servants: Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it. And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. Jesus saith unto them: Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And He saith unto them: Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.

When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants which drew the water knew), the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and saith unto him: Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth His glory; and His disciples believed on Him.

The Third Sunday after Epiphany
The Collect
O Lord, we beseech Thee mercifully to receive the prayers of Thy people, and to turn the hearts of sinners to the wisdom of the just, that they may rejoice in the return of health and obtain pardon and peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the tenth chapter of the Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans, beginning at the eighth verse.

THE word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith which we preach; that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the Scripture saith: Whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him. For whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the eighth chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the first verse.

WHEN He was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped Him, saying: Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean. And Jesus put forth His hand and touched him, saying: I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

And Jesus saith unto him: See thou tell no man; but go thy way, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

And when He was entered into Capernaum, there came unto Him a centurion, beseeching Him, and saying: Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. And Jesus saith unto him: I will come and heal him. The centurion answered and said: Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof; but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.

When Jesus heard it, He marvelled, and said to them that followed: Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. And I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.

Septuagesima Sunday
(Approximately 17 days before Lent)

O Lord, we beseech Thee favourably to hear the prayers of Thy people, and stretch forth the right hand of Thy majesty to defend us from all adversities which may happen in body or soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the ninth chapter of the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians, beginning at the twenty-fourth verse.

KNOW ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air; but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the twentieth chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the first verse.

THE kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and said unto them: Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.

Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and saith unto them: Why stand ye here all the day idle? They say unto him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them: Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.

So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward: Call the labourers and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should receive more; and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, saying: These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day.

But he answered one of them and said: Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way; I will give unto this last even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good? So the last shall be first, and the first last.

Sexagesima Sunday
(Approximately 10 days before Lent)

The Collect
O Lord God, who seest that we put not our trust in anything that we do, mercifully grant that by Thy power we may be defended against all adversity; through Jesus Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the eleventh chapter of the Second Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians, beginning at the nineteenth verse.

YE suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. For ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.

Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I. Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more: in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not? If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the eighth chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the fourth verse.

WHEN much people were gathered together, and were come to Him out of every city, He spake by a parable: A sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. And some fell upon a rock, and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it. And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold.

And when He had said these things, He cried: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. And His disciples asked Him, saying: What might this parable be? And He said: Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to others in parables, that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.

Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. Those by the wayside are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. They on the rock are they which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. And that which fell among thorns are they which, when they have heard, go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. But that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.

Quinquagesima Sunday
(The Sunday before Ash Wednesday)

The Collect
O Lord, who hast taught us that all our doings without charity are nothing worth, send Thy Holy Ghost and pour into our hearts that most excellent gift of charity, the very bond of peace and of all virtues, without which whosoever liveth is counted dead before Thee; grant this for Thine only Son Jesus Christ’s sake. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians, beginning at the first verse.

THOUGH I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

Charity suffereth long and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

Charity never faileth; but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the eighteenth chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the thirty-first verse.

THEN Jesus took unto Him the twelve and said unto them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man shall be accomplished. For He shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on; and they shall scourge Him and put Him to death; and the third day He shall rise again.

And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

And it came to pass that as He was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging; and hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. And he cried, saying: Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me!

And they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace; but he cried so much the more: Thou Son of David, have mercy on me! And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto Him; and when he was come near, He asked him, saying: What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said: Lord, that I may receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him: Receive thy sight; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God; and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.

Ash Wednesday
(The First Day of Lent)

The Collect
Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with Thy most gracious favour, and further us with Thy continual help; that in all our works, begun, continued, and ended in Thee, we may glorify Thy holy Name, through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

This Collect is to be said every day in Lent, after the Collect appointed for the day.

The Epistle
The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle is taken from the third chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, beginning at the nineteenth verse.

REPENT ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. And He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you; Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.

For Moses truly said unto the fathers: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever He shall say unto you. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. Unto you first, God, having raised up His Son Jesus, sent Him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the third chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the third verse.

JESUS said unto Nicodemus: Amen, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus said unto Him: How can a man be born when he is old? And Jesus answered: Amen, Amen, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

Amen, Amen, I say unto thee, we speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.

The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for every day after, unto the next Sunday.

The First Sunday in Lent
(Intent: Self-Examination)

The Collect
O Lord, Who for our solace hast appointed divers seasons unto Thy Church, grant us so justly to examine ourselves that, discerning clearly our faults, we may truly amend them, and thus prepare ourselves fitly to celebrate Thy holy Feast of Easter, O risen Lord; unto Whom be praise and adoration for evermore. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the fifth chapter of the Second Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians, beginning at the ninth verse.

WE labour that we may be accepted of Him, for we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. The love of Christ constraineth us; therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

Give no offence in anything, in all things approving yourselves by pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left. Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the third chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the sixteenth verse.

GOD so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the Name of the only-begotten Son of God.

And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

The Second Sunday in Lent
(Intent: Control of Speech)

The Collect
O God, Who unto man alone hast given the power of speech wherewith to praise Thee, grant that our hearts may be so filled with love and wisdom that we may speak evil of no man, but evermore glorify Thy holy Name, through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the third chapter of the General Epistle of St. James, beginning at the second verse.

IF any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able to bridle the whole body. For every kind of beasts and of birds, and of serpents and of things in the sea, hath been tamed of mankind; but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. The tongue is a little member, but it boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity; so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.

Therewith bless we God, even the Father, and therewith curse we men, who are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the sixth chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the forty-first verse.

WHY beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? How canst thou say to thy brother: Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye; when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.

For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. For every tree is known by his own fruit; for of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

The Third Sunday in Lent
(Intent: Understanding)

The Collect
O God Who knowest all things, and art therefore all-forgiving, grant us grace so to look upon the hearts of our brethren that we may never fail in understanding and compassion, through Christ the Lord of love, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, throughout all ages of ages. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the third chapter of the First General Epistle of St. Peter, beginning at the eighth verse.

BE ye all of one mind, having compassion one on another; love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous; not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing, knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.

For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile. Let him eschew evil and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves; for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the eighth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the third verse.

THE Pharisees brought unto Jesus a woman who had been unfaithful to her husband, and when they had set her in the midst, they said unto Him: Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act; now Moses in the Law commanded us that such should be stoned; but what sayest Thou? This they said, tempting Him, that they might have wherewith to accuse Him.

But Jesus stooped down, and with His finger wrote on the ground, as though He heard them not. So when they continued asking Him, He lifted Himself up, and said unto them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. And they who heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.

When Jesus had lifted Himself up, and saw none but the woman, He said unto her: Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her: Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more.

The Fourth Sunday in Lent
(Refreshment Sunday)
(Intent: Spiritual Refreshment)

The Collect
Almighty God, Who art unto Thy people a Fountain of Wisdom, a Tower of Strength, and an ever-shining Sun of Beauty and Harmony, grant that we may so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries of the Passion and the Resurrection that we may ever be refreshed by the continual outpouring of Thy power from on high, through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the fourth chapter of that of St. Paul the Apostle to the Philippians, beginning at the eleventh verse.

I HAVE learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound; everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ Who strengtheneth me.

Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report: if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do; and the God of peace shall be with you. Rejoice in the Lord alway; and again I say, Rejoice. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand, and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the sixth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the third verse.

JESUS went up into a mountain, and there He sat with His disciples. And when He lifted up His eyes, and saw a great company come unto Him, He saith unto Philip: Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? Philip answered: Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.

One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto Him: There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many? Jesus said: Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. And Jesus took the loaves; and when He had given thanks, He distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.

When they were filled, He said unto His disciples: Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. Then those men, when they had seen this miracle which Jesus did, said: This is of a truth that prophet which should come into the world.

The Fifth Sunday in Lent, or
Passion Sunday
Intent: Humility
The Altar Cross is veiled in violet gauze.
The Collect
O LORD, Who didst lay aside Thy glory, and take upon Thee the earthly robe of mortal flesh, we pray for wisdom to avoid the specious snare of pride, and ever to walk humbly and heedfully in Thy sight, Who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Ghost throughout all ages of ages. R. Amen.
The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the twelfth chapter of that of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans, beginning at the second verse.
BE not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. For I say to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation. He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, for it is written: Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the eighteenth chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the ninth verse.
HE spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying: God be merciful to me, a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. And they brought unto Him also infants, that He should touch them; but when His disciples saw it, they rebuked them. But Jesus called them unto Him, and said: Suffer little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God. Amen, I say unto you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
The Sunday Next before Easter, or
Palm Sunday
The Blessing of the Palms
The procession enters as usual. Upon reaching the chancel the palm branches upon the table are uncovered. The antiphon "Hosanna Filio David" is then sung, as followeth:
Priest. Hosanna to the Son of David: blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord.
People. O King of Israel: Hosanna in the highest.
The Priest sprinkles the palms thrice with holy water and says:
Let us pray.
The people kneel.
O God, Who gatherest the things that are dispersed, and preservest what is gathered; Thou that didst bless the people, who, bearing branches, went out to meet Jesus; do Thou also + purify and + bless these boughs of palm which Thy servants faithfully take up in honour of Thy Name, that unto what place soever these branches be brought, the dwellers therein may obtain Thy blessing, and, every adversity being chased therefrom, Thy right Hand may protect those whom Thy Son Christ doth watch over and love. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.
The people are seated.
The Priest blesses incense and censes the palms thrice. He then turns to the people and says:
Receive a branch of palm, ye who desire to greet the Lord with joy and gladness.
The branches are now distributed to the clergy and the people; a branch is fastened to the top of the processional cross. The procession forms in the chancel and the Priest sings:
P. Let us go forth in peace.
C. In the Name of Christ.
The procession moves through the church and out of the door singing an appropriate hymn.* The door is closed at the end of the hymn, and the people within turn in its direction and sing the first verse of "All glory, laud, and honour." This verse is repeated by those without the door. The people and choir then sing the next verse, and those on the outside repeat the refrain, which is the same as the first verse. This is done alternately throughout all the verses, all, however, joining in the refrain after the last verse. The cross-bearer then knocks at the church door with the base of the processional cross; the door is immediately opened, and the procession enters singing some appropriate hymn. The Holy Eucharist now begins as usual.
Hymn 132 is suitable.
The Collect
O LORD Christ, before Whom in Thy one earthly triumph the children of the Hebrews did cast their votive palms, grant unto Thy faithful servants that in Thine own good time we too may bear the palm of victory, and may be found worthy to stand in Thy holy Presence, Thou Who dwellest ever in the unity of the Father and the Holy Spirit throughout all ages of ages. R. Amen.
The Epistle
The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle is taken from the nineteenth chapter of the Revelation of St. John the Divine, beginning at the first verse.
I HEARD a great voice of much people in heaven saying: Alleluia; salvation and glory and honour and power unto the Lord our God, for true and righteous are His judgments. And again they said Alleluia. And the four-and-twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the Throne, saying: Amen, Alleluia; and a voice came out of the Throne saying: Praise our God, all ye His servants and ye that love Him, both small and great. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying: Alleluia; for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth: let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to Him. And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His Head were many crowns; and His name is called The Word of God; and He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-first chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the first verse.
WHEN they drew nigh unto Jerusalem and were come to Bethphage unto the Mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying unto them: Go unto the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her; loose them and bring them unto Me. And if any man say aught unto you, ye shall say: The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them. And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them, and brought the ass and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set Him thereon. And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees and strewed them in the way. And the multitude that went before and that followed cried, saying: Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest. And when He was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved, saying: Who is this? And the multitude said: This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for every day until Maundy Thursday.
NOTE ON HOLY WEEK SERVICES
The traditional services at the conclusion of Holy Week, in which the successive events in the mystery-drama of the Gospels from Thursday to Easter Sunday are portrayed, are an interesting survival of primitive rites of the Church.
Maundy Thursday takes its name from the opening words of the antiphon Mandatum novum do vobis ("a new commandment I give unto you"), which introduces the ancient ceremony of the washing of the feet. Apart from this ceremony, which is not observed among us, the day is kept in honour of the institution of the Holy Eucharist, and the Celebration is one of festal splendour, with procession of the Blessed Sacrament. On this day also the Bishop, in his cathedral church, consecrates the Holy Oils to be used for the succeeding year.
On Good Friday the Church commemorates the solemn event of the crucifixion in the mystery-drama. From the evening of Maundy Thursday the church is stripped of earthly pomp and splendour, and there is no Celebration until that of the Resurrection on Easter morning. Instead, on Friday and Saturday there is celebrated the Eucharist of the Presanctified, in which the consecration is omitted, the Priest receiving a Host consecrated or "presanctified" on Maundy Thursday.
The traditional offices of this and the following day are protracted by the reading of long passages from the Old Testament, but these are not part of our rite. In the Eastern Church a Mass of the Presanctified is enjoined for all days in Lent, except Saturdays and Sundays.
In ancient times the people spent the night before Easter in prayer and watching. During this night the water in the baptismal font was blessed and catechumens were baptized in readiness to share in the Celebration of the Resurrection at dawn. In preparation for all this, long discourses and scripture readings were given for the edification of the faithful. Part of the symbolism, also, was the blessing of the new fire, and the lighting therefrom of the paschal candle and the lamps of the church. During the middle ages a tendency to anticipate liturgical events came increasingly and irresistibly into evidence, and now the Roman Catholic Church celebrates the Mass of Resurrection, as well as the blessing of the new fire and of the baptismal font, on the Saturday morning.
The Liberal Catholic rite has reverted to the older and surely sounder usage of not celebrating the Eucharist of the Resurrection until Easter morning.
Maundy Thursday
White vestments are used, and the purple veil covering the cross during Holy Week is replaced by one of white.
The Collect
O GOD, Who in this wonderful Sacrament hast left us a perpetual memorial of Thy love; may we, by the inspiration of Thy Holy Spirit, so reverence the sacred mysteries of Thy Body and Blood, that we may the more worthily receive this Thy most glorious gift and blessing. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.
The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the eleventh chapter of the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians, beginning at the twenty-third verse.
FOR I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said: Take, eat; this is My Body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of Me. After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, saying: This cup is the new testament in My Blood; this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of Me. For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do show the Lord's death till He come.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the sixth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the forty-seventh verse.
AMEN, Amen, I say unto you, he that believeth on Me hath everlasting life. I am that Bread of life. This is the Bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living Bread which came down from heaven; if any man eat of this Bread, he shall live for ever: and the Bread that I will give is My Flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat? Then Jesus said unto them: Amen, Amen, I say unto you, except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His Blood, ye have no life in you; whoso eateth My Flesh and drinketh My Blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For My Flesh is meat indeed, and My Blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My Flesh, and drinketh My Blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me. This is that Bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this Bread shall live for ever.
Four large Hosts are consecrated, one for this Celebration, the other three for subsequent use.
During the singing of the Adeste Fideles, the Blessed Sacrament is carried round the church in procession in the monstrance. If this hymn be not long enough, it should be supplemented by some other Eucharistic hymn.
At evening a ciborium containing the three Hosts is carried out, in solemn procession if there be an evening service. These, together with some Particles for possible use of the sick, should be reserved in a tabernacle in the sacristy or some other convenient place out of the church. Two of these Hosts are required for the Masses of the Presanctified on Good Friday and Holy Saturday respectively, and the third is to be placed in the tabernacle of the high Altar before the first Celebration on Easter Day, or on Saturday evening, if the first Vespers of Easter and Benediction be celebrated.
After the evening service the Altars are stripped of flowers, cloths and frontals, the tabernacle door left open, and the cross again veiled in violet.
The Office of Blessing the Oils on Maundy Thursday will be found later in this Book.
Good Friday
The Altar is covered with a plain linen cloth and violet frontal, but otherwise unadorned. No candles are lighted. If convenient, Prime may be sung before the special service of the Day. If that be done the lessons which follow shall be used as the First and Second Lessons at Prime in place of the Epistle and Gospel.
The First Lesson
The First Lesson is taken from the fifty-eighth chapter of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, beginning at the third verse.
Wherefore have we fasted, say men, and Thou seest not? Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and Thou takest no knowledge? Is it such a fast that I have chosen? saith the Lord. A day for a man to afflict his soul, to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen—to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thine house, and when thou seest the naked that thou cover him? Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thy health shall spring forth speedily, and thy righteousness shall go before thee; and the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward.
Here endeth the First Lesson.
The Second Lesson
The Second Lesson is taken from the twelfth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, beginning at the twenty-third verse.
Jesus said: The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified. Amen, Amen, I say unto you, except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there shall also My servant be.
Here endeth the Second Lesson.

EUCHARIST OF THE PRESANCTIFIED

The Collect
LORD Christ, Whose life Thy Church doth lay before us as a perfect ensample for our imitation, grant us that we may have strength so to follow Thee through suffering and mystical death, that we may rise with Thee into the ineffable splendour of Easter, Who livest and reignest throughout the ages of ages. R. Amen.

The Collects for Ash Wednesday and for Peace are then said, and the Epistle and Gospel follow in the usual form.

The Epistle

The Epistle is taken from the first chapter of the Second Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians, beginning at the third verse.

BLESSED be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer; or whether we be comforted, that also is for your consolation and salvation. And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the ninth chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the eighteenth verse.
AND Jesus asked His disciples: Whom say the people that I am? They answering said: John the Baptist; but some say Elias; and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again. He said unto them: But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said: The Christ of God. And He straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell to no man that thing, saying: The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and Scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day. And He said to them all: If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily, and follow Me. For whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after Me, cannot be My disciple. Likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever will lose his life for My sake, the same shall save it.
The sermon, if there is to be one, follows here.
The Priest (or deacon) now places the cross upon the centre of the Altar, and as it is unveiled the people kneel. The officiant, other clergy and ministers approach the Altar from the farther end of the sanctuary or chancel by three stages; at the end of each stage they genuflect. During the first genuflection the following versicle and response are sung:
P. Holy art Thou, O God.
C. Holy art Thou, O God.
During the second genuflection:
P. Holy art Thou, O Mighty One.
C. Holy art Thou, O Mighty One.
During the third genuflection:
P. Holy art Thou, O Immortal One; pour out Thy love upon us.
C. Holy art Thou, O Immortal One; pour out Thy love upon us.
This last genuflection having taken place, the following hymn is sung:
These phrases are a translation of the ancient Trisagion ("thrice-holy") of the Greek Liturgy. In the traditional Latin rite these Greek and Latin phrases are sung antiphonally, as follows:
Hagios O Theos.
Sanctus Deus.
Hagios Ischyros.
Sanctus Fortis.
Hagios Athanatos, eleison hemas.
Sanctus Immortalis, miserere nobis.
Apart from the Kyrie eleison, this is the only instance of the use of Greek in the Roman rite. Greek was the original liturgical language at Rome, and Greek and Latin are the two ancient liturgical languages of the Church.
TAKE up thy cross, our Master said,
If thou would'st My disciple be;
Deny thyself, the world forsake,
And humbly follow after Me.
Take up thy cross; let not its weight
Fill thy weak spirit with alarm;
His strength shall bear thy spirit up,
And brace thy heart, and nerve thine arm.
Take up thy cross, nor heed the shame,
Nor let thy foolish pride rebel;
Thy Lord for thee the cross endured,
To save thy soul from death's dark spell.
Take up thy cross, and follow Christ,
Nor think till death to lay it down;
For only he who bears the cross
May hope to wear the glorious crown.
To Thee, great Lord, the One in Three,
All praise for evermore ascend;
O grant us in our Home to see
The heavenly life that knows no end. Amen.
Towards the end of the hymn the candles are lighted on the Altar, and lastly the cross is moved back to its accustomed place. A procession is formed, and returns with lights and incense to the high Altar, the celebrant bearing a ciborium containing a Host consecrated on the previous day. The Host is placed on the corporal; wine and water are poured into the chalice, but without the usual prayers. The Priest censes the offerings and the Altar in the usual way. Having washed his fingers in silence, he says:
ORATE FRATRES.
Brethren, pray that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Father Almighty.
C. May the Lord receive the sacrifice at thy hands, and sanctify our lives in His service.
He continues:
O Lord, we offer and present unto Thee ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a holy and continual sacrifice unto Thee. May our strength be spent in Thy service and our love poured forth upon Thy people. R. Amen.
The Priest proceeds immediately to the following prayers:
P. We praise and thank Thee, holy Lord, for the glory of Thy saints, and we (here he makes the sign of the holy cross with the paten from his forehead to his breast) join with them in worship before Thy great white throne, whence flow all love and light and blessing through all the worlds which Thou hast made.
He elevates the Host for the adoration of the people. Immediately he breaks the Host over the chalice in the usual way, dropping the Particle into the chalice, but in silence. He then says:
O Thou Who in this adorable Sacrament hast left us a living memorial and pledge of Thy marvellous love for mankind, and dost therein graciously draw us into wondrous and mystic communion with Thee; grant us so to receive the sacred mysteries of Thy Body and Blood that our souls may be lifted into the immensity of Thy love, and that, being filled with a high endeavour, we may ever be mindful of Thine indwelling Presence and breathe forth the fragrance of a holy life. R. Amen.
The Priest consumes the sacred Host in the usual manner, after which in silence he receives the contents of the chalice.
He concludes with the following Postcommunion prayer:
We pray Thee, O Lord, that Thy grace may be so grafted inwardly in our hearts, that it may continually be made manifest in our lives. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.
The Altar cloth is removed.
At evening Compline may be said.
Holy Saturday
The Altar is covered with a plain linen cloth and violet frontal, but otherwise unadorned. No candles are yet lighted. The colour is violet.
If convenient, Prime may be sung before the special service of the Day. If that be done, the lessons which follow shall be used as the First and Second Lessons at Prime in place of the Epistle and Gospel.

The First Lesson
The First Lesson is taken from the thirty-seventh Psalm of King David, beginning at the third verse.
Put thou thy trust in the Lord, and be doing good: delight thou in the Lord, and He shall give thee thy heart's desire. Commit thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in Him, and He shall bring it to pass. He shall make thy righteousness as clear as the light, and thy just dealing as the noonday. O rest in the Lord; wait patiently for Him; for the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
Here endeth the First Lesson.

The Second Lesson
The Second Lesson is taken from the fourteenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, beginning at the first verse.
Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto Myself, that where I am there ye may be also. Now, I have told you before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass ye might believe. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
Here endeth the Second Lesson.

THE BLESSING OF THE FIRE
At a convenient time before the service fire is kindled outside the Church. It is desirable that the tinder from which this fire is ignited should be lighted from the sun by means of a lens, but if that be not possible, flint and steel should be used.
The service begins with the Asperges. Then a procession is formed which moves to the door of the Church. The glowing embers are placed in an appropriate vessel, such as an open thurible. The Priest blesses the new fire in this wise:
Let this fire be + purified and + blessed by Him in Whose honour it is kindled.
Some charcoal for burning incense is lighted from the new fire and placed in another thurible.
Five pellets of incense are blessed.
P. Let this incense be + purified and + blessed by Him to Whom its fragrance is dedicated.
The triple candle is lighted from the new fire and blessed.
P. Let this candle be + purified and + blessed by Him Who is the Light of the world.
The procession returns. If there be a subdeacon and deacon, the former bears the five grains of incense. The deacon, who in the meantime has been vested in a white dalmatic, bears the triple candle, lighted from the new fire. Otherwise an attendant bears the incense, and the Priest takes the candle. During the procession four genuflections are made by all who take part therein. At each the deacon raises the triple candle and sings:
Deacon. Christ is our Light.
C. May His Light shine in our hearts.
The procession having arrived at the Altar, the deacon says:
Cleanse my heart and my lips, O God, Who by the hand of Thy Seraph didst cleanse the lips of the prophet Isaiah with a burning coal from Thine Altar, and in Thy lovingkindness so purify me that I may worthily proclaim Thy holy gospel. Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.
The Priest blesses him in the usual manner:
May the Lord be in thy + heart and on thy + lips, that through thy heart the love of God may shine forth, and through thy lips His power be made manifest. R. Amen.
D. The Lord be with you.
C. And with thy spirit.
D. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men; and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all might believe through him. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into this world.
He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His Name; which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. (All now genuflect.) And the Word was made Flesh (all rise again), and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
The deacon now fixes into the paschal candle the five grains of incense, and the Priest blesses the candle, saying:
Let this candle be + purified and + blessed by Him in Whose honour it shall be burned.
The deacon lights the paschal candle and Altar candles from the triple candle, and also any other lamps of the church (save that which burns before the Blessed Sacrament).
P. Let us pray.
Blessed Lord, may our hearts be so stirred by Thy power during this Easter Festival that, arising from the darkness of sin and ignorance, we may shine with the splendour of Thy light, O Thou Who art our Sun of Righteousness. R. Amen.
The deacon resumes the violet dalmatic. If it be convenient, a baptism may now be performed, in accordance with the ancient custom of the Church.
After the water has been blessed in the usual manner, the Priest lowers the base of the triple candle into the water and makes with it the sign of the cross in the water thrice, saying:
In the Name of the + Father, and of the + Son, and of the Holy + Ghost. R. Amen.
The baptism being ended, the Eucharist of the Presanctified follows. It begins with four Collects, the first from the ordinary Eucharistic service, the second as given below, the third that of Ash Wednesday, and the fourth the customary Prayer for Peace, after which the Epistle and Gospel are read as usual.
The Collect
LORD CHRIST, Whose Life Thy Church doth lay before us as a perfect ensample for our imitation, grant that we may follow Thee through mystic burial into newness of life, Who livest and reignest in eternal glory. R. Amen.

The Epistle

The Epistle is taken from the third chapter of the First Epistle General of St. Peter, beginning at the fourteenth verse.
BUT and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye; and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you; having a good conscience, that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. It is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing. For Christ also hath once suffered, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. By which also He went and preached to the spirits in prison, but now is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, Angels and Authorities and Powers being made subject unto Him.
Here endeth the Epistle.

The Gospel

The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-seventh chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the fifty-seventh verse.

WHEN the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple. He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying: Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while He was yet alive: After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him away, and say unto the people: He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them: Ye have a watch; go your way, make it as sure as ye can. So they went and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
The sermon, if there is to be one, is given here. Then the procession is formed to bring in the Presanctified Host, and the remainder of the service follows exactly the course of that of the preceding day.

Easter Day
The Collect
O GOD of Love, we praise Thee, we bless Thee,
with all our hearts do we thank Thee and magnify
Thy name for this most holy and wondrous Festival
of Easter, for in the glorious victory which in it is
commemorated and symbolized, Thou hast given us
the sure and certain witness that good shall finally
triumph over ill, and that death is but a gateway
to the ineffable splendour of eternal life in Thee, O
never-setting Sun of Righteousness, Who livest and
reignest God for ever and ever.
℟ Amen.
The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the fifteenth chapter of the First Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians, beginning at the twelfth verse.
NOW if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen; and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain. But some man will say: How are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come? That which thou sowest is not quickened except it die, and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body which shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain. But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own body. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. For there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. So this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be to God, Who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-eighth chapter of that according to St. Matthew, beginning at the first verse.
AS it began to dawn towards the first day of the week came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake, for the Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow, and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. And the Angel said unto the women: Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus, Who was crucified. He is not here; He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead. And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, and did run to bring His disciples word. And as they went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying: All hail. And they came and took Him by the feet, and worshipped Him.
The First Sunday after Easter, or Low Sunday
The Collect
O LORD Christ, by Whose eternal Sacrifice we exist, and in Whose victory we triumph, grant that, in joy or in sorrow, we may never lose our grateful memory of Thine unchanging love, Who livest and reignest God throughout all ages.
℟ Amen.
Then shall be read the Collect for Easter Day.
The Epistle
The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle is taken from the tenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, beginning at the thirty-fourth verse.
PETER opened his mouth, and said: Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him. The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all), that word (I say) ye know, which was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost, and with power; Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with Him. And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; Whom they slew, and hanged on a tree; Him God raised up the third day, and showed Him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with Him after He rose from the dead. And He commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He Who was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-fourth chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the thirteenth verse.
BEHOLD, two of His disciples went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about three-score furlongs. And they talked together of all these things which had happened. And it came to pass that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus Himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden, that they should not know Him. And He said unto them: What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said unto Him: Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? And He said unto them: What things? And they said unto Him: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, Who was a prophet mighty in deed and word, before God and all the people; and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and have crucified Him. But we trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed Israel; and, besides all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done. Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; and when they found not His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of Angels, which said that He was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said; but Him they saw not. Then He said unto them: O fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken; ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory? And, beginning at Moses, and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. And they drew nigh unto the village whither they went, and He made as though He would have gone further; but they constrained Him, saying: Abide with us, for it is towards evening, and the day is far spent. And He went in to tarry with them. And it came to pass, as He sat at meat with them, He took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him, and He vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another: Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us by the way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures? And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, saying: The Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon. And they told what things were done in the way, and how He was known of them in breaking of bread.
The Second Sunday after Easter
The Collect
O LORD Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, Who as at holy Eastertide didst rise from the darkness of death to shine with exceeding glory upon Thy people, hasten Thou Thy Coming, we pray Thee, that once more that brightness may rise upon our longing eyes, and that all the earth may be filled with Thy glory, even as the waters cover the sea, Thou Who dwellest ever in the unity of the Father and the Holy Ghost throughout all ages of ages.
℟ Amen.
The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the fifth chapter of the First Epistle General of St. John, beginning at the fourth verse.
WHATSOEVER is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? This is He that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood; and it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. For there are Three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these Three are One. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life; and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son hath not life.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the twentieth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the nineteenth verse.
THE same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them: Peace be unto you. And when He had so said, He showed unto them His hands and His side. Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again: Peace be unto you; as My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you. And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and saith unto them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.
The Third Sunday after Easter
The Collect
O LORD Christ, as Thou didst at this season rise from death into the wondrous power of an endless life, so may we by Thy most gracious help rise from the darkness of sin into the ineffable splendour of conscious life in Thee, O Light of Light, Who livest and reignest for evermore.
℟ Amen.
The Epistle
The Epistle is taken from the second and third chapters of the Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Colossians, beginning at the sixth verse.
AS ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him; rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. For in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; and ye are complete in Him, Who is the Head of all principality and power; buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God, Who hath raised Him from the dead. If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth; for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-fourth chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the thirty-sixth verse.
JESUS Himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them: Peace be unto you. And He said: These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets and in the Psalms concerning Me. Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His Name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things.
The Fourth Sunday after Easter
The Collect
O CHRIST our Lord and Master, grant that as Thou hast risen from the dead, Thy people may rise from ignorance to the firm ground of true knowledge, and thence press onwards towards the mount of heavenly wisdom, where fair peace forever dwells, Thou Who livest and reignest throughout the ages of ages.
℟ Amen.
The Epistle
The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle is taken from the thirteenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, beginning at the twenty-seventh verse.
THEY that dwell in Jerusalem, though they found no cause of death in Him, yet desired they Pilate that He should be slain. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of Him they took Him down from the tree, and laid Him in a sepulchre. But God raised Him from the dead, and He was seen many days of them which came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses unto the people. And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that He hath raised up Jesus again; as it is written in the Psalm, Thou shalt not suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the sixteenth chapter of that according to St. Mark, beginning at the first verse.
WHEN the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint Him. And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. And they said among themselves: Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? And when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away; for it was very great. And, entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment, and they were affrighted. And he saith unto them: Be not affrighted; ye seek Jesus of Nazareth Which was crucified. He is risen; He is not here; behold the place where they laid Him. But go your way, tell His disciples and Peter that He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see Him, as He said unto you.
The Fifth Sunday after Easter
The Collect
LORD Christ, Whose wondrous triumph Thy faithful people year by year do celebrate, we pray Thee that as the years roll on we also may triumph over sin, and, following Thy glorious ensample, may rise unto the fullness of our spiritual heritage, O Thou Who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit, God throughout all ages of ages.
℟ Amen.
The Epistle
The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle is taken from the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, beginning at the twenty-second verse.
YE men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by Him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death; because it was not possible that He should be holden of it. For David speaketh concerning Him, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the sixteenth chapter of that according to St. Mark, beginning at the ninth verse.
NOW when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils. And she went and told them that had been with Him, as they mourned and wept. And they, when they heard that He was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not. After that He appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country. And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them. Afterward He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen. And He said unto them: Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.

Ascension Day
The Collect
O GOD, the King of glory, we pray Thee that, as Thine only-begotten Son our dear Lord Christ hath ascended into the heavens, we may also in heart and mind thither ascend, and with Him continually dwell, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, throughout all ages of ages.
℟ Amen.
The Epistle
The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle is taken from the first chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, beginning at the fifth verse.
JESUS said unto His Apostles: John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. And ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto Me, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. And when He had spoken these things, while they beheld, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven, as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said: Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the twenty-fourth chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the forty-ninth verse.
BEHOLD, I send the promise of My Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. And He led them out as far as to Bethany, and He lifted up His hands, and blessed them. And it came to pass, while He blessed them, He was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. And they worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for nine days after.
After the Gospel on Ascension Day, when the deacon has censed the celebrant, the latter shall reverently extinguish the Paschal Candle, saying:
The great forty days are over; the Lord hath ascended into heaven; and so in His Name I extinguish this Paschal Candle, which for forty days has symbolized among us His risen body, for a token that as its light, leaving this lower world, passes to higher realms, so may we in heart and mind thither ascend and with Him continually dwell.
Whitsunday
The Collect
O GOD, Who as at this time didst teach the hearts of Thy faithful people by the sending to them the light of Thy Holy Spirit, grant us by the same Spirit to have a right judgment in all things, and evermore to rejoice in His holy comfort; through the love of Christ our Master, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee, in the unity of the same Spirit, one God, throughout all ages of ages.
℟ Amen.
The Epistle

WHEN the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. And they were all amazed, and marvelled, saying one to another: Behold, are not all these which speak Galileans? And how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians—we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the fourteenth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the sixteenth verse.
JESUS said unto His disciples: I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of Truth, Whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him; but ye know Him; for He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth Me no more; but ye see Me; because I live, ye shall live also. The Comforter, Which is the Holy Ghost, Whom the Father will send in My Name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
Trinity Sunday
The Collect
O ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, Who hast given unto us Thy servants by the confession of a true faith to acknowledge the glory of the eternal Trinity, and in the power of the Divine Majesty to worship the Unity; we pray Thee that Thou wouldest keep us steadfast in this knowledge, and evermore defend us from all error, Who livest and reignest, one God, throughout all ages of ages.
℟ Amen.
The Epistle
The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle is taken from the fourth chapter of the Book of the Revelation of St. John the Divine, beginning at the second verse.
IMMEDIATELY I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. And He that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone; and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings, and thunderings, and voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. And when those beasts give glory, and honour, and thanks to Him that sat on the throne, Who liveth for ever and ever, the four and twenty elders fall down before Him that sat on the throne, and worship Him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the fourteenth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the sixth verse.
JESUS said: I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me. He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; for I am in the Father, and the Father in Me. I and My Father are one; as the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you; and this is My commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you. When the Comforter is come, Whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of Me. And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with Me from the beginning. By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another.
Corpus Christi
The Collect
O CHRIST our holy Lord, Who in this wonderful Sacrament of the Altar hast given unto us the grace of Thy perpetual Presence and an abiding memorial of Thy surpassing love; grant us so to receive this Thy most precious gift, that our hearts may be pure in Thy sight and our lives ever dedicated to Thy service, Who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God throughout all ages of ages.
℟ Amen.
The Epistle

FOR I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you: that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread; and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said: Take, eat; this is My Body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of Me. After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, saying: This cup is the new testament in My Blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of Me. For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do show the Lord's death till He come.
Here endeth the Epistle.
The Gospel
The holy Gospel is taken from the sixth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the forty-seventh verse.
AMEN, amen, I say unto you: He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life. I am that Bread of life. This is the Bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living Bread which came down from heaven; if any man eat of this Bread, he shall live for ever; and the Bread that I will give is My Flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying: How can this man give us His flesh to eat? Then Jesus said unto them: Amen, amen, I say unto you: Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His Blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth My Flesh, and drinketh My Blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For My Flesh is meat indeed, and My Blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My Flesh and drinketh My Blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me. This is that Bread which came down from heaven; not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this Bread shall live for ever.
At the chief celebration of the Holy Eucharist the Blessed Sacrament is carried round the Church in procession in the monstrance during the singing of the Adeste Fideles. If this hymn be not long enough, it should be supplemented by some other Eucharistic hymn. At the evening service there should be Solemn Benediction and procession of the Sacred Host.
The same Collect, Epistle and Gospel shall serve for the following Sunday and until the Second Sunday after Trinity.

## Second Sunday after Trinity

**Intent:** GOD as Light

### The Collect

O Father of Light, in Whom is no darkness at all; may our hearts be so irradiated by the glory of Thy divine Love that we may ever shine as beacons amid the stormy sea of life; that through us weary and tempest-driven souls may be guided to the haven where they would be, and may rest in the eternal sunlight of Thy holy Presence, through Christ our Lord.  
℟. Amen.

### The Epistle

The Epistle is taken from the first chapter of the First Epistle General of St. John, beginning at the third verse.

> That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. These things write we unto you that your joy may be full. This then is the message which we have heard of Him and declare unto you, that God is Light, and in Him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness we lie, and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another. He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.

*Here endeth the Epistle.*

### The Gospel

The holy Gospel is taken from the twelfth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the thirty-second verse.

> I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me. Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you; for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. He that believeth on Me, believeth not on Me only, but on Him that sent Me; and he that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on Me should not abide in darkness.

## Third Sunday after Trinity

**Intent:** GOD as the Ruler of Angels

### The Collect

O God the King of Angels, Ruler of all the Hosts of heaven, we praise and thank Thee for the help which these Thy radiant servants so joyously do render unto us, and pray that we may pattern after them in purity and zeal, through Christ our Lord.  
℟. Amen.

### The Epistle

The portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle is taken from the twelfth chapter of the Book of Tobit, beginning at the sixth verse.

> And the Angel said unto them: Bless God, praise Him and magnify Him, and praise Him for the things which He hath done unto you in the sight of all that live. It is good to praise God and exalt His Name, and honourably to show forth the works of God; therefore be not slack to praise Him. Do that which is good, and no evil shall touch you. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold; for those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filled with life, but they that sin are enemies to their own life. God hath sent me to heal thee and thy daughter, for I am Raphael, one of the seven holy Angels which present the prayers of the saints, and go in and out before the glory of the Holy One.
>
> Then they were troubled and fell upon their faces; for they feared. But the Angel said unto them: Fear not; it shall go well with you. Not of any favour of mine, but of the will of our God I came; therefore praise Him for ever and give Him thanks, for I go up to Him that sent me.
>
> Then they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the Angel of the Lord had appeared unto them; and they said: Blessed art Thou, O God, and blessed is Thy name for ever; and blessed are all Thy holy Angels.

*Here endeth the Epistle.*

### The Gospel

The holy Gospel is taken from the first chapter of that according to St. Luke, beginning at the eighth verse.

> While Zacharias executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. And there appeared unto him an Angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him; but the Angel said unto him: Fear not, Zacharias; thy prayer is heard, and thou shalt have joy and gladness. I am Gabriel, that stand in the Presence of God; and I am sent to speak unto thee, and to show thee these glad tidings.

## Fourth Sunday after Trinity

**Intent:** GOD as Love

### The Collect

O Christ, the Lord of Love, we lay our hearts upon Thy shrine, praying that Thou wilt accept, purify and enkindle them, so that they may forever glow with the undying fire of Thine infinite compassion, Who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God throughout all ages of ages.  
℟. Amen.

### The Epistle

The Epistle is taken from the fourth chapter of the First Epistle General of St. John, beginning at the seventh verse.

> Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God, and everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is Love. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us His Spirit. God is Love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love Him, because He first loved us. If a man say: I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God, Whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from Him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.

*Here endeth the Epistle.*

### The Gospel

The holy Gospel is taken from the fifteenth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the first verse.

> I am the true vine, and My Father is the Husbandman. I am the Vine, ye are the branches. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing. Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples. As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you; continue ye in My love. If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love. These things have I spoken unto you, that My joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. These things I command you, that ye love one another.

## Fifth Sunday after Trinity

**Intent:** GOD as Peace

### The Collect

Grant, O Lord, that the course of this world may soon be so peaceably ordered by Thy governance that Thy Church may joyfully serve Thee in all godly quietness, through Christ our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Ghost, ever One God throughout all ages of ages.  
℟. Amen.

### The Epistle

The Epistle is taken from the fifth chapter of that of St. Paul the Apostle to the Galatians, beginning at the thirteenth verse.

> Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only, use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. This I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance; against such there is no law. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

*Here endeth the Epistle.*

### The Gospel

The holy Gospel is taken from the fourteenth chapter of that according to St. John, beginning at the eighteenth verse.

> Jesus said: I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you. Because I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you. He that hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him. If a man love Me, he will keep My words; and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him. He that keepeth not My sayings loveth Me not. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
