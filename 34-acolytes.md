316 ORDINATION OF ACOLYTES 


The ordinands kneel before the Bishop in succession. 
He places his right hand on the head of each, as he 
says: 


In the Name of Christ our Lord, I admit thee to 
the Order of Exorcist. 


Lhe Bishop hands a sword and a book to each ordin- 
and, saying: 

Take this sword for a. symbol of the will, and this 
book for a symbol of knowledge, whereby thou shalt 
be strong in the warfare of the spirit. 


Having ordained the several candidates, he blesses the 
new Eaxorcists in the following words, unless they are 
immediately to receive another Order: 


The blessing of God Almighty, the + Father, the 
+ Son, and the Holy + Ghost come down upon you, 
that you may rightly fulfil that which to-day you 
have undertaken. R. Amen. 


THE ORDINATION OF ACOLYTES 


At the appointed time those about to be made Acolytes 
are summoned by a Priest, as follows: 


Let those who are to be ordained to the Office 
of Acolyte come forward. 


The ordinands rise from their seats and advance a 
few paces towards the Bishop, bearing lighted candles 
in their hands. They bow to him, the candles are then 
taken from them, and they are seated while the Bishop 
charges them, as follows: 


It was the duty of the Acolyte in olden times to 
carry the candlestick, to light the tapers and lamps 
of the church, and to present wine and water for 
the Eucharistic offering. These duties are no longer 
confined to the Acolyte, but are usually discharged by 
lay boys or men; therefore, as in the case of the 
previous Orders, we treat the duties as symbolical 
and invest them with a moral significance. Where ~ 
the Acolyte served before the Altar of the church, 


ORDINATION OF ACOLYTES 317 


you now serve before the altar of the human heart, 
on which each man must truly offer himself as a sac- 
rifice to God. You will have noticed that in the 
former degrees the training consisted partly in the 
cultivation of your own powers, but also in learning 
to exercise those powers for the helping of others. 
Assuredly this training through which you have pass- 
ed were vain did it not lead you for Christ’s sake to 
consecrate your powers to the wider interests of hu- 
manity. Remember the words of the Christ, how 
He said, ‘‘Whosoever will be great among you let him 
be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among 
you let him be your servant: even as the Son of 
Man came not to be ministered unto but to minister.’’ 
Wherefore as you are about to offer yourselves to 
Him to be enrolled in the fellowship of those who 
seek to be in very truth spiritual servers of the world, 
do you endeavour in singleness of heart to perform 
the office you now undertake. For then only will 
you meetly present wine and water to be used at the 
Sacrifice of God, when by the continual practice of 
unselfishness you shall have offered yourselves as 
an acceptable sacrifice to God. 


In the ancient symbolism of this Order the candi- 
date, in addition to receiving a cruet as the visible 
token of this sacrifice, is also given a candlestick 
with a candle, and told that he is bound to light the 
lights of the church in the Name of the Lord. That 
lighting of lights may be your duty in the literal 
sense, and it should be done, as indeed should all 
duties of the daily life, as an act of service in the 
Name of the Lord. But it is also intended that 
you should bear ever with you the spiritual light of 
Christ’s holy Presence, and strive to enkindle that 
sense of His Presence within the hearts of your 
brethren, who form the great catholic Church of hu- 
manity. In many forms of religious faith light has 
been taken as a symbol of Deity—the Light which 
lighteth every man that cometh into the world. That 
Light is universal, but it also dwells in the heart of 


318 ' ORDINATION OF ACOLYTES 


man. It is our duty to see that Light in everyone, 
however dimly it may burn, however veiled and dark- 
ened it may appear to our ordinary perception. And 
having learned thus to recognize the Light both in 
ourselves and in others, we may help them to cause 
that radiance of their inner Divinity to shine forth 
in its pristine glory and splendour, till the Light 
within becomes one with the universal Light without. 
To this end, indeed, are we constantly admonished in 
the words of the Christian scriptures: ‘‘Let your 
light so shine before men that they may see your good 
works and glorify your Father Who is in heaven.’’ 
‘‘They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of 
the firmament, but they that turn many to righteous- 
ness as the stars for ever and ever.’’ ‘‘Let your 
loins be girded about and your lights burning.’’ 
Again, the Apostle Paul says: ‘‘Inthe midst of a crook- 
ed and perverse generation, among whom shine ye as 


lights in the world.’’ ‘‘Let us therefore cast off — 
the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour 
of light.’’ ‘‘For ye were sometimes darkness, but 


now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of 
light.’’ 


This degree of Acolyte is intended to help you to 
quicken your spiritual faculties, and especially the 
intuition through which the light of the divine love 
and wisdom may lighten your understanding. As 
you fulfil worthily your ministry by helping others, 
so shall you be helped by those Great Ones, Whose 
ears are never deaf, Whose hearts are never closed 
against the world They love. 


_ The charge being ended, the ordinands kneel before 
the Bishop, who rises and says: 


Let. us pray. 


O Lord Christ, Who art ever ready to receive and 
to strengthen the earnest aspirations of Thy chil- 
dren, look down in Thy love upon these Thy ser- 
vants who desire to become worthy to serve Thee as 
Acolytes in Thy holy Church. Sanctify + them, 





ORDINATION OF ACOLYTES 319 


O Lord, with Thy heavenly grace, that growing con- 
tinually in virtue they may rightly practise the 
duties of their office and so be found acceptable in 
Thy sight, O Thou great King of Love, to aS 
be glory for ever and ever. R. Amen. 


The ordinands kneel before the Bishop in succession. 
He places his right hand on the head of each, saying: 


In the Name of Christ our Lord, I admit thee to 
the Order of Acolyte. 

The. Bishop hands a candlestick with lighted candle 
to each ordinand, saying: 

As thou. dost bear this visible light, so shalt thou 
ever shed around thee the brightness of the divine 
Light. 

The Bishop hands a cruet to each ordinand, saying: 


See to it that thou dost pour out thy life in union 
with the great Sacrifice by which the world is main- 
tained. 


The Bishop endues each ordinand with the badge of 
the Order, saying: 

I endue thee with the badge of the Order of Acolyte; 
see that thou dost use it as a channel of Christ’s love 
for men. 

Let us pray. 

O Christ, the Lord of Love, we worship at Thy Feet, 
and once more we dedicate ourselves to Thy service; 
let the seven Rays of Thine ineffable glory shine 
through these sacred symbols, that they may ever be 
as radiant suns to those who wear them, and foun- 
tains of light and benison to all Thy faithful people, 
Thou Who lovest and reignest for ever. R. Amen. 

Having ordained the several candidates, he blesses the 
new Acolytes in the following words, unless they are 
immediately to recewe another Order: 

The blessing of God Almighty, the + Father, the 
+ Son, and the Holy + Ghost come down upon you, 
that you may with steadfastness and zeal persevere 
in that. which to-day you have undertaken. R. Amen.
