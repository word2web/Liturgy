ORDINATION OF EXORCISTS 313 





The charge being ended, the ordinands kneel before 
the Bishop, who rises and says: 


Let us pray. 


O Lord Christ, Who art ever ready to receive and 
to strengthen the earnest aspirations of Thy chil- 
dren, look down in Thy love upon these Thy ser- 
vants who desire to become worthy to serve Thee 
as Readers in Thy holy Church. Sanctify + them, 
O Lord, with Thy heavenly grace, that growing 
continually in virtue they may rightly practise the 
duties of their office and so be found acceptable in 
Thy sight, O-Thou great King of Love, to Whom be 
glory for ever and ever. R. Amen. 


The ordinands kneel before the Bishop in succession. 
He places his right hand on the head of each, as he says: 

In the name of Christ our Lord, I admit thee to the 
Order of Reader. 


The Bishop hands a book to each ordinand, saying: 


Study diligently the Sacred Science, that thou may- 
est the better be able to devote thy mind and all its 
powers to the service of God. 


Having ordained the several candidates, he blesses the 
new Readers in the following words, unless they are im- 
mediately to receive another Order: 

The blessing of God Almighty, the + Father, the 
+ Son, and the Holy + Ghost come down upon you, 


that you may rightly fulfil that which to-day you 
have undertaken. R. Amen. 


THE ORDINATION OF EXORCISTS 
At the appointed time those about to be made Eaor- 
cists are summoned by a Priest, as follows: 
Let those who are to be ordained to the Office of 
Exorcist come forward. 


The ordinands rise from their seats and advance a few 
paces towards the Bishop, bearing lighted candles in

their hands. They bow to him, the candles are then taken 
from them, and they are seated while the Bishop charges 
them, as follows: 


It was the duty of the Exorcist in the ancient 
Church to cast out devils, to warn the people that 
non-communicants should make room for those who 
were going to communion, and to pour out the water 
needed in divine service. The Book of Exorcisms 
was handed to him with the words: ‘‘Take and com- 
mit this to memory, and receive the power to lay 
hands on demoniacs, whether they be baptized or 
catechumens.’’ The candidate was admonished that 
as he cast out devils from the bodies of others he 
should rid his own mind and body of all unclean- 
ness and wickedness, lest he be overcome by those 
whom he drove out of others by his ministry. For 
then only would he be able safely to exercise mastery 
over the demons in others, when he should first 
have overcome their manifold wickedness within 
himself. 


Such exorcism as is now performed in the Church 
is undertaken only by those who have been ordained 
Priest, and even for them a special authorization is 
usually required; also with the passage of time the 
other duties attaching to the Office of Exorcist have 
fallen into abeyance. Moreover, our conception of 
these matters is different in some respects from that 
entertained in former times. Men of old thought 
of temptation as being due to the attacks of demons 
from without. But in truth this is not generally 
so, There lies behind each one of us a past which, 
since we are growing in grace, must have been less 
desirable than the present. There are habits; very 
instincts, built into the bodies, which rise against us 
when we try to live the higher life. This which we 
try to conquer is not a devil of great power attack- 
ing us from outside, nor is it even inherent wicked- 
ness in ourselves. It is the consequence and relic 
of earlier action permitted in days of ignorance. 
In this grade of Exorcist it is your duty by strenuous

effort to develop the power of the will, and by its 
exercise to cast out from yourselves the evil spirit 
of separateness and selfishness. Having learned to 
control your own evil habits, you will have greater 
power to help others to cast out the evil from them- 
selves, not only by example but by precept, and even 
by direct action on your part. In olden time it was 
often true, and still in rare cases remains true, that, 
through weakness or by persistence in evil, men al- 
lowed their bodies to become obsessed or partially 
controlled by evil spirits. To some, especial power 
and authority are given to hold unclean spirits in 
check and to cast out this evil influence from the 
bodies of others. There are some, too, who possess 
the gift of healing, and are able by the virtue flow- 
ing from them to alleviate suffering and soothe af- 
flictions of the body; this gift may likewise be 
strengthened in the Order of Exorcist; indeed, in 
ancient times the Exorcist was regarded as a healer in 
the Church. 


Wherefore, dearly beloved sons, strive diligently 
in this new office to which you are called to exercise 
mastery over yourselves, that you may the more ef- 
fectively help others to gain a similar mastery over 
their weakness. 


The charge being ended, the ordinands kneel before 
the Bishop, who rises and says: 


Let us pray. 


O Lord Christ, Who art ever ready to receive and 
to strengthen the earnest aspirations of Thy chil- 
dren, look down in Thy love upon these Thy ser- 
vants who desire to become worthy to ‘serve Thee as 
Exorcists in Thy holy Church. Sanctify -+ them, 
O Lord, with Thy heavenly grace, that growing con- 
tinually in virtue they may rightly practise the 
duties of their office and so be found acceptable in 
Thy sight, O Thou great King of’Love, to Whom 
be glory for ever and ever. R. Amen.
