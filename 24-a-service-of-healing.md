A SERVICE OF HEALING 


The purpose of the Service of Healing is twofold; 
first, to bring spiritual upliftment to those who are 
in sore need thereof; second, to give some relief, when 
possible, to those whe are suffering from various phys- 
ical ills. ; 

At the outset, by means of the Asperges, the 
thought-atmosphere of the Church is purified and 
made ready for the coming of a healing Angel, who 
is immediately thereafter invoked. The Confiteor 
follows, and the attitude of those who join in those 
glowing sentences should be an earnest desire to rise 
above the imperfections of their nature, and to live 
the higher and nobler life. Such an attitude of in- 
tense earnestness calls to the deeps within us and 
arouses our spiritual powers to activity. The Priest 
then pronounces the Absolution. It must be remem- 
bered that this does not relieve a man of responsi. 
bility for the consequences of his wrong-doing, be- 
cause it is only by paying each debt which he con- 
tracts that be can learn the great lessons of life. 
Absolution dues make it easier, however, to do what 
is right after a mistake has been made, by clearing 
away the mental and emotional entanglements which 
blind the inner nature, and by straightening out dis- 
tortions in the etheric body. 

The people rise and sing a hymn which is intend- 
ed to incline their hearts to the Christ, and to en- 
able them to feel the nearness of His Presence and 
the wonder of His Love. The words of this hymn 
should be felt as well as sung by those who desire 
help. St. James’s instructions as to the anointing 
of the sick are then read, and the Veni Creator, which 
is the traditional call for the aid of God the Holy 
Ghost, is sung by His kneeling worshippers. While 
this is sung, for eyes that can see, the whole Church 
slowly fills with that glorious glow of fire which is 
the outward token of the power of the Presence of 
the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity; and in the 
strength of that Presence the Priest sends forth that

cleansing current of exorcism which is intended to 
clear away anything that might block the way of the 
healing force. 


This next step is to follow the apostolic custom 
of anointing the patient with consecrated oil, invok- 
ing the mighty Leader of the Hosts of the healing An- 
gels, the Archangel Raphael. The possibility of an- 
gelic assistance is unsuspected by the vast majority 
of people in this blind and materialistic age, but it 
is nevertheless a wonderful and beautiful fact which 
will be comprehended more and more clearly as the 
years roll on. Then the Priest lays his hands upon 
the patient’s head, and pours into him, with all the 
strength which God has given to him, the uplifting 
and curative force of the Lord Christ. He has been 
specially prepared by his ordination to be a channel 
for this force and for ‘the power of God the Holy 
Spirit, so in doing this he is but exercising one of 
the functions of his ministry. If a Bishop conducts 
the Service he has the additional opportunity of help- 
ing by the imposition of his crosier, the healing power 
of which has long been recognized. 


During the anointing and the laying on of hands 
the attitude of the patient should be that of love for 
our Lord Christ and confidence in His mighty power. 
The whole nature should be opened to the downpour- 
ing spiritual influence, even as a flower opens its 
chalice to the sun. The less the thoughts of a per- 
son are centred upon himself at this supreme moment, 
the more the depths of his nature are responsive to 
the compassionate Presence of the Christ, and the 
greater is the possibility of cure. 


The last great means of spiritual aid and physical 
healing is now given to the patient in the Holy Com- 
munion. No greater help both for body and soul 
can be offered than this, for with the reception of 
the Sacred Host the human body becomes for a few 
hours a veritable shrine, radiating the glowing love 
and power of the Christ.

It is not expected that those instantaneous cures 
which are commonly (though wrongly) called mirae- 
ulous will often oceur at these Services. They may 
and they do happen in certain cases; but we are not 
yet sufficiently conversant with the method of work- 
ing of these stupendous powers to be able to predict 
results. Many patients, especially chronic cases, feel 
considerable temporary improvement, but gradually 
relapse and slip back either partially or entirely. 
Such patients should try again. Where there is a 
slight amelioration, only temporary at the first at- 
tempt, a second may well carry it further; a third, a 
fourth, a fifth, a sixth may carry it much further 
still. Even the Christ Himself had to apply His 
treatment twice in the case of the man born blind. 

If a patient is not restored to health even after 
repeated trials it must not be thought that Christ 
cannot cure, that the Holy Spirit cannot cure; it 
should be remembered that the channels are human, 
frail and imperfect, and it may well be that, for any 
one of a dozen reasons, the divine force does not flow 
through this Priest or that in just the way that will 
cure a particular patient. The Priest will do his best 
to help; the patient will do his best to prepare him- 
self to be helped; what will come of it is in higher 
hands than ours—in the hands of Christ the Healer 
and the King. es

THE INVOCATION 


The Priest wears a red stole. The people stand. The 
Priest says: 


In the Name of the Father, 4 and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 
ASPERGES 


Receiving the aspergill, he makes the sign of the 
cross over himself with it, saying: ; 


May the Lord purify me that I may worthily per- 
form His service. 


A SERVICE OF HEALING 975 





Sprinkling the Altar in the middle, then the chan- 
cel to his left and to his right, he continues: 


In the strength of the Lord do I repel all evil from 
this holy Altar and sanctuary: 


Then turning to the people and sprinkling them 
with the same triple motion: 


und from this House, wherein we worship Him; 
Turning back to the altar and resigning the aspergill: 


nd I pray our heavenly Father that He will 
send His healing Angel to minister unto these Thy 
servants here present, that they may be restored to 
lealth of mind and body. Through Christ our Lord. 
. Amen, 

CONFITEOR 
| All kneel, and say together: 
© Lord, Thou hast created man to be immortal, and 
nade him to be an image of Thine own eternity; yet 
ften we forget the glory of our heritage, and wan- 
er from the path which leads to righteousness. But 
Thou, O Lord, hast made us for Thyself, and our 
earts are ever restless till they find their rest in 
thee. Look with the eyes of Thy love upon our 
nanifold imperfections, and pardon all our short- 
omings, that we may be filled with the brightness 
f the everlasting light, and become the unspotted mir- 
v of Thy power and the image of Thy goodness. 
feos Christ our Lord. Amen. 


THE ABSOLUTION 


The Priest rises, goes to the Altar, and, turning to 

he people, who remain kneeling, says: 

| God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost 

less, -+ preserve and sanctify you; the Lord in His 
vingkindness look down upon you and be gracious 
to you; the Lord -X absolve you from all your 
ns and grant you the grace and comfort of the Holy 
irit. R. Amen. 


The people rise and sing:

HYMN. 


Immortal Love, for ever full, 
For ever flowing free, 

For ever shared, for ever whole, 
A never-ebbing sea. 


Our outward lips confess the Name 
All other names above; 

Love only knoweth whence it came, 
And comprehendeth love. 


We need not climb the heavenly steeps 
To bring the Lord Christ down; 
Alike within the lowest deeps 
Is He, of heaven the Crown. 


But warm, sweet, tender, even yet 
A present help is He; 

And faith has still its Olivet, 
And love its Galilee. 


The healing of His seamless dress 
Is by our beds of pain; 

We touch Him in life’s throng and press, 
And we are whole again. 


Through Him the first fond prayers are said 
Our lips of childhood frame; 
The last low whispers o’er our dead 
Are uttered in His Name. 
Alone, O Love ineffable, 
Thy holy Name is given; 
A thousand saints Thy glories tell 
Who in that Name have striven. 


Lord Christ, of Love and Joy the Sun, 
Undying praise to Thee, 
With Father and with Spirit One, 
Through all eternity. Amen. 
The people are seated. 
READING FROM SCRIPTURE 
P. Hear the words of the Apostle James: 


Is any sick among you? let him call for the | 
elders of the Church; and let them pray over him, 








A SERVICE OF HEALING 277 





anointing him with oil in the Name of the Lord. 
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the 
Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed 
sins, they shall be forgiven him. Pray for one an- 
other that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent 
prayer of a righteous man availeth much. 


All kneel while the following appeal is sung: 
VENI CREATOR 


Come, Thou Creator Spirit blest, 

And in our souls take up Thy rest; 

Come with Thy grace and heavenly aid, 
To fill the hearts which Thou hast made. 


Great Paraclete, to Thee we cry, 
O highest gift of God most high; 
O living Fount, O Fire, O Love, 
And sweet anointing from above. 


Thou in Thy sevenfold gifts art known; 
Thee, Finger of God’s Hand, we own, 
The promise of the Father, Thou 

Who dost the tongue with power endow. 


Kindle our senses from above, 

And make our hearts o’erflow with love; 
With patience firm and virtue high 

The weakness of our flesh supply. 


Far let us drive our tempting foe, 
And Thine abiding peace bestow; 
So shall we not, with Thee for guide, 
Turn from the path of life aside. 


O may Thy grace on us bestow 

The Father and the Son to know, 

And Thee, through endless times confessed, 
Of both eternal Spirit blest. 


All glory while the ages run 

Be to the Father and the Son, 

Who gave us life; the same to Thee, 
O Holy Ghost, eternally. Amen.

THE UNCTION 


The Priest descends from the Altar and goes to the 
place in the chancel at which he is to administer 
Holy Unction. 


P. Let us pray. 
The people kneel. 


O Lord, Who hast given unto man bodily health 
“and vigour wherewith to serve Thee, we pray Thee to 
free Thy servants from their sickness so far as may 
be expedient for them, and by the might of Thy ++ 
blessing to restore unto them full health, both out- 
wardly in their bodies and inwardly in their souls. 
Through Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The people are seated. Those who desire to be 
anointed are brought to the Priest one by one, and kneel 
upon a cushion. The Priest now says over each one: 


In the Name which is above every name, in the 
power of the + Father, and of the + Son, and of 
the Holy + Ghost, I exorcize all influences of evil, 
that thou mayest be rightly purified to receive this 
Sacrament of Holy Unction. 


Taking upon his thumb some of the holy oil for the 
sick, the Priest anoints the person in the form of a 
cross upon the forehead, saying: 


In the Name of our Lord Christ, and invoking the 
help of the holy Archangel Raphael, I + anoint thee 


with oil, that thou mayest gain refreshment, both of 
soul and body. } 


The Priest proceeds to anoint, in the same manner 
as before, but im silence, the centre at the top of the 
head, the front of the throat and the nape of the neck. 
He then places both hands upon the head of the person 
with the definite intent to heal, saying: 


Christ, the Son of God, look down upon thine afflic- 


A SERVICE OF HEALING 279 





tion, and heal thee of all thine infirmities. May the 
Light of His Love enfold thee forever.* 

If a Bishop is conducting the service he may at this 
point touch the person with his crosier. 

When all desiring the sacrament of Holy Unction 
have been anointed, the Priest cleanses his hands and, 
turning to the people, says: 

As with this visible oil your bodies are outwardly 
anointed, so may Almighty God, our heavenly Father, 
grant of His infinite goodness that your souls may 
be anointed inwardly with the Holy Ghost, Who 
is the Spirit of strength, relief and gladness. And 
may He so replenish you with the spirit of His Wis- 
dom and strengthen you with His mighty power, that 
you may persevere in the way of holiness and ever 
serve Him joyfully in the course that He hath ap- 
pointed for you. Through Christ our Lord. R. 
Amen, 

[The Priest turns to the Altar and says: 

O God, Who in the wonderful sacrament of the Al- 
tar has left us a living memorial of Thine eternal 
Sacrifice; grant us, we beseech Thee, so to venerate 
the sacred mystery of Thy Body and Blood that we 
may ever perceive within ourselves the power of Thine 
indwelling life, and thus, by the glad pouring out 
of our lives in sacrifice, may know ourselves to be one 
with Thee, and through Thee with all that lives; who 
livest and reignest with the Father in the unity of 
the Holy Spirit, God, throughout all ages of ages. R. 
Amen. | 

Those who have been anointed kneel at the Chancel 
rail, and the Priest administers Holy Communion to 
them, saying to each: 

The Body of our Lord Christ keep thee unto life 
eternal. 

When all have partaken, the people rise and sing: 





*The following alternative formula may be employ- 
ed if preferred: ‘‘Christ the Son of God pour down 
His healing power upon thee, and enfold thee in the 
Light of His Love.’’

HYMN. 


Great Master, Whose Name is the Healer, 
O enter this poor heart of mine 
And make it for ever Thy dwelling, 
A home wherein all things are Thine. 
O Son of the Father eternal, 
Be with me, a Friend and a Guest; 
Abide in Thine own human mansion, 
Its Joy and its Hope and its Rest. 


Leave in me no darkness unlighted, 
Unwarmed by Thy Truth’s holy fire; 

No thought which Thou canst not inhabit 
No purpose Thou dost not inspire. 

Shut in into silence, my midnight 
Is dawn if Thy Presence I see; 

When I open my doors to Thy coming, 
lio! all things are radiant with Thee. 


O what is so sweet as to love Thee 
And live with Thee always in sight ? 
Lord, enter this house of my being, 
And fill every room with Thy Light. 
All honour and praise to the Father, 
All honour and praise to the Son, 
All honour and praise to the Spirit, 
The Three Who forever are One. Amen. 


P. -Let us pray. 

We who have been refreshed with Thy heavenly 
gifts do pray Thee, O Lord, that Thy grace may be 
so grafted inwardly in our hearts that it may con- 
tinually be made manifest in our lives, through Christ 
our Lord. R. Amen. . 


THE BENEDICTION. 


The Priest turns to the people. 

Unto God’s gracious love and protection we commit 
you; the Lord 4 bless you and keep you; the Lord 
make His Face to shine upon you and be gracious 
unto you; the Lord lift up the light of His Counten- 
ance upon you and give you His peace, now and for 
evermore. R. Amen. 3 


A SERVICH OF HEALING 281 





If there be two Priests present the work may be 
divided between them. The patients may be ar- 
ranged along the Chancel rail, a considerable space 
being left between them, and the Priests may pass 
from one to another, precisely as at the administra- 
tion of the Holy Eucharist. The first Priest may 
pronounce the exorcism, anoint the patient, and lay 
his hands upon him; the second Priest may repeat 
the laying on of hands, and may then administer the 
Holy Communion before the patient leaves his place 
at the rail. In that case the Communion will pre- 
cede the prayer, ‘‘As with this visible oil.’’ If 
there be more than two Priests, the others may come 
between the first and second abovementioned, each 
of them simply laying his hands on each patient, and 
using only the formula: ‘‘Christ the Son of God, 
ete.” 

s 
_ If it be desired to hold a special intercessory Ser- 
vice for sick persons who cannot be present, the Holy 
Eucharist may be offered for that intention, the Col- 
lect, Epistle and Gospel prescribed on pages 177-179 
being used, and the names of the sick being mentioned 
‘in the usual place. 

_ The Benediction of the Most Holy Sacrament may 
also be used as an intercessory Service for the sick, 
in which case the Litany should be sung with spec- 
ial intention for the sick, or it may be replaced 
by another. 

_ After the prayer following the TYantwm Ergo the 
prayer ‘‘For the Sick,’’ on page 278, should be used, 
and the names to be commemorated read aloud. If 
there be many names, the Priests may read them 
aloud before the prayer, saying: ‘‘The prayers of the 
congregation are desired for ——,’’
