THE ORDINATION OF DOORKEEPERS 


At the appointed time those about to be made Door- 
keepers are summoned by a Priest, as follows: 


“Let those who are to be ordained to the Office of 
Doorkeeper come forward. 


The ordinands rise from their seats and advance a 
few paces towards the Bishop, bearing lighted candles 
in their hands. They bow to him, the candles are then 
taken from them, and they are seated while the Bishop 
charges them, as follows: ‘ 

It was the duty of the Doorkeeper in olden times 
to ring the church bells, to open the church at the 
appointed times to the faithful but to keep it ever 
closed to unbelievers, to open the book for the preach- 
er and to guard with diligence the church furniture, 
lest any should be lost. In our time these functions 
no longer appertain to the Order of Doorkeeper, but 
rather do we treat them as symbolical, and invest 
them with a moral significance. It will thus be 
your duty as Doorkeepers to keep the keys of your 
heart, to open the heart at all times for the expres- 
sion of that which is noble and good, but sternly 
to keep it closed against evil and unworthy sugges- 
tions. As it is your duty to keep your own heart, 
so should you also seek to predispose the hearts of 
others to things which are beautiful, and in persua- 
sive language to set forth to them the attractiveness

of noble ideals. Thus may you, in these days, dis- 
charge the duties of service which marked the work 
of our earlier brethren. 


In this degree you learn control of the emotions 
and passions, as before you learned to master the 
crude instincts of the physical body. There are 
those who have thought of emotion as necessarily 
evil, and have taught others to uproot it from the 
nature. Not for you is it to think thus. God has 
given us the power to feel emotion, and it, too, is 
a power which can become mighty in His service. 
At whatever stage a man’s emotions may. be, they 
represent the working of the divine power within 
him, and should not be suppressed, but raised and 
consecrated to the service of God. If through care- 
lessness. or selfishness the emotions have been allow- 
ed to become self-centred, it is our duty not to kill 
them out, but to purify and raise them; to substitute 
for devotion to our own pleasure devotion to God 
and humanity; to put aside, as far as may be, af- 
fection for self for the affection that gives, caring 
nothing for any return; not to ask love, but to give 
love. Hence it is your task as Doorkeepers to train 
your emotions, laying them as a gift on Christ’s holy 
Altar, that they too may be used in His service. 


The charge being ended, the ordinands kneel before 
the Bishop, who rises and says: 


Let us pray. 


O Lord Christ, Who art ever ready to. receive and 
to strengthen the earnest aspirations of Thy chil- 
dren, look down in Thy love upon these Thy ser- 
vants who desire to become worthy to serve Thee as 
Doorkeepers in Thy holy Church. Sanctify + them, 
O Lord, with Thy heavenly grace, that growing con- 
tinually in virtue they may rightly practise the 
‘duties of their office and so be found acceptable in 
‘Thy sight, O Thou great King of Love, to Whom be 
glory for ever and ever. R. Amen.
