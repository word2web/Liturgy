THE ORDINATION OF CLERICS 


At the appointed time those about to be made Clerics 
are summoned by a Priest, as follows: 


Let those who are to be ordained to the Office of 
Cleric come forward. 


The ordinands rise from their seats and advance a few 
paces towards the Bishop, bearing lighted candles in 
their hands, They bow to him, the candles are then taken 
from them, and they are seated while the Bishop charges 
them, as follows: 


Those who in ancient days desired to dedicate 
their lives to the service of Christ’s holy Church 
were admitted, as a preliminary step, to this Order 
of Cleric. Being set apart from the life of the 
world, they were admonished to put away worldly 
distractions and secular desires, the abandonment 
of which, as typified by outer adornment of the per- 
son, was indicated by the shaving of hair from the 
head and the relinquishment of secular garb. 


You, who now come before us, are likewise mind- 
ed to dedicate yourselves to the service of Christ, 
and desire to enter this ancient Order that you may 
receive help and instruction in preparing yourselves — 
for the life of service. In these later days it is no 
longer necessary to be tonsured or to wear a special | 
dress outside of the church; but none the less is it 


i ORDINATION OF CLERICS 307 





true that he who wishes faithfully to serve the 
Christ must set himself apart from the world, in 
that considerations of Christ’s work must take pre- 
eminence over the fulfilment of merely personal de- 
sires. 


In this grade of Cleric you set before yourselves 
a great and glorious ideal—to become fellow-workers 
with God, to co-operate in His Plan for the perfect- 
ing of His creation. For this you must both learn 
self-control and acquire additional powers. Instead 
of allowing your body to direct and enslave you, you 
should endeavour to live for the soul. Wherefore 
as a first step you must learn in this grade of Cleric 
to control, and rightly to express yourselves through, 
the physical body, as in the next stage, that of Door- 
keeper, it will be your duty to control, and rightly 
to develop, the emotions, that whatever power in 
them lies may be used for the service of God. In 
the grade of Reader you are taught to take in hand 
the powers of the mind and devote those also to God’s 
service. Having thus diligently laboured at the 
training of the body, the emotions and the mind, 
you enter upon a higher phase of your work, and in 
the Order of Exorcist you develop more definitely 
the power of the will, that you may conquer evil in 
yourselves and such evil suggestions as may be im- 
posed upon you from outside; also you will now the 
better be able to help others to cast out evil from 
their natures. Above the grade of Exorcist lies 
that of Acolyte, wherein your task is to quicken 
the intuition and to open yourselves to all manner 
of spiritual influence. 


Beyond these grades, which among us are intended 
for the many, there lies for the few a higher, though 
straiter service; in which the man is to set him- 
self wholly apart for the service of the Christ, and, 
having passed the probationary grade of Subdeacon, 
enters upon the Greater Orders of Deacon and Priest. 
But even should you elect not to enter upon this 
higher path, yet happy indeed will you be, for even 


308 ORDINATION OF CLERICS 


in the Minor Orders you will have unfolded many 
powers within yourselves, and with those powers 
rightly developed and trained will be able to offer 
acceptable service to Him in Whose service alone is 
perfect freedom. 


In this Order of Cleric, then, you must learn 
self-control with regard to the body. It must be 
trained to habits of accuracy and neatness; it must 
‘be kept in perfect health and cleanliness, and you 
must see that it devotes its energies to God’s ser- 
vice, not in disorderliness and selfishness, but in har- 
mony and rhythm. In your gesture, in your man- 
ner and your speech, strive to show forth the ideal 
of beauty, never forgetting that our physical bodies 
are the temple of the Holy Ghost. Moreover, as 
you learn to respect your own body, so must you 
scrupulously respect the bodies of others, picturing 
them ever as the temple of the eternal Beauty. 


The charge being ended, the ordinands kneel before the 
Bishop, who rises and says: 


Let us pray. 


O Lord Christ, Who art ever ready to receive and 
to strengthen the earnest aspirations of Thy chil- 
dren, look down in Thy love upon these Thy servants 
who desire to become worthy to serve Thee as Clerics 
in-Thy holy Church. Sanctify + them, O Lord, 
with Thy heavenly grace, that growing continually 
in virtue they may rightly practise the duties of 
their office and so be found acceptable in Thy sight, 
O Thou great King of Love, to Whom be glory for 
ever and ever. R. Amen. 


The ordinands kneel before the Bishop im succession. 
He places his right hand on the head of each, as he says: 


In the Name of Christ our Lord, I admit thee to 
the Order of Cleric. 


The Bishop places a surplice on each of the ordin- 
ands, saying to him: 


ORDINATION OF DOORKEEPERS: 309 


I clothe thee with the vesture of holiness, and do 
admonish thee diligently to develop the powers that 
are in thee, that thy service may be of good effect. 


Having ordained the several candidates, he blesses the 
new Clerics in the following words, unless they are 
immediately to receive another Order: 


The blessing of God Almighty, the + Father, the 
+ Son, and the Holy + Ghost come down upon you, 
that you may rightly fulfil that which to-day you 
have undertaken. R. Amen.
