BENEDICTION OF THE MOST 
HOLY SACRAMENT 


In this service the people receive the blessing of 
Christ Himself through the Most Holy Sacrament. The 
latter is first exposed in the monstrance for the adora- 
tion and veneration of the people. Then the Priest, 
covering his hands with the humeral veil, takes the mon- 
strance, and gives the Solemn Benediction. The greatest 
devotion should mark this service. 

Sometimes the Host is carried in procession. 


THE INVOCATION 


. P. In the Name of the Father, > and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 


The people kneel. The Priest removes the’ Most 
Holy Sacrament from the tabernacle and places LY im the 
monstrance. 


All kneel, and the Priest offers incense before the 
Most Holy Sacrament. Meanwhile the people sing the 
following hymn, or, tf there be no music, it is said after 
the censing: 

O SALUTARIS HOSTIA 


O Saving Victim, opening wide 
The gate of heaven to man below, 

Our foes press in from every side; 
Thine aid supply, Thy strength bestow. 


All praise and thanks to Thee ascend 
For evermore, blest One in Three; 
O grant us life that shall not end 
In our true native land with Thee. Amen. 


The following Litany is sung, the people kneeling. If 
_ there is to be a Procession of the Most Holy Sacrament, 

tt takes place during the Litany, the Host being car- 
ried under a Canopy. If it be convenient the Priest 
alone (or a cantor appointed by him) may sing the 
first, third, fifth, and other verses bearing odd nwm- 
bers, the even verses being sung by the choir and the 
people.

God the Father, seen of none, 

God the co-eternal Son, 

God the Spirit—Three in One, 
We are Thine, O Trinity. 


A time may be set apart at this place for meditation. 


The following hymn is neat sung, a few moments’ 
pause being made if it follows directly upon the 
Litany. After the first verse, the officiant again puts 
incense into the thurible and censes the Blessed Sacra- 
ment as before, during which action the people con- 
tinue the second verse; but if there be no music a 
pause is observed until after the censing. 


The people remain kneeling. 


TANTUM ERGO, 
(At the second line all bow low in adoration) 


Therefore we, before Him bending, 
This great Sacrament revere, 

Types and shadows have their ending, 
For the newer rite is here. 

Faith, our outward sense befriending, 
Makes our inward. vision clear. 


Glory let us give, and blessing, 
To the Father and the Son, 
Honour, might, and praise addressing, 
While eternal ages run; 
Ever, too, His love confessing, 
Who from Both with Both is One. Amen. 


P. Thou didst give them bread from heaven. 

C. Containing within itself all sweetness. 

P. O Lord Christ, Thou Hidden Dweller in the hu- 
man spirit: 

C. Open Thine eyes in us, that we may see. 

P. O God, who in the wonderful Sacrament of the - 


Altar hast left us a living memorial of Thine eternal 
Sacrifice; grant us, we beseech Thee, so to venerats the 





_SOLEMN BENEDICTION 223 


a 
sacred mystery of Thy Body and Blood that we may 


ever perceive within ourselves the power of Thine 
indwelling life, and thus, by the glad pouring out of our 
lives in sacrifice, may know ourselves to be one with 
Thee, and through Thee with all that lives; Who livest 
and reignest with the Father in the unity of the Holy 
Spirit, God throughout all ages of ages. BR. Amen. 


When this Service of Benediction follows immediately 
after Vespers the following Prayer for Peace has been 
already said, and will therefore be omitted in this place. 


P. Teach us, O Lord, to see Thy life in all men, 
and. in all the peoples of Thine earth, and- guide our 
nation through its leaders to preserve Thy peace, that 
the menace of war be far from our days, through 
Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


THE ASCRIPTION 


P. To the most: holy and adorable Trinity, Father, 
Son and Holy Spirit, three Persons in one God; to 
Christ our Lord, the only wise Counsellor, the Prince 
of Peace; to the seven mighty Spirits before the 
throne; and to the glorious Assembly of just men 
made perfect, the Watchers, the Saints, the Holy Ones, 
be praise unceasing from every living creature; and 
honour, might and glory, henceforth and-for ever- 
more. R. Amen.

The following hymn may be sung either as a retro- 
cessional or before the procession passes out. 


CLOSING HYMN 


Closed is the solemn hour, 
The sacred rites are done: 
And lo! the music of Thy power 
Thrills through us, every one. 
O Master, let that harmony 
Sing through the lives we lead for Thee ! 


And now with reverent pace, 
Our strength renewed by Thine, 
Devoted guardians of Thy Grace, 
Quit we this holy shrine, 
And pass into the silent night, 
To be the bearers of Thy light. Amen.

Salutaris Hostia, the Tantwm Ergo, the Versicles and | 
Responses and Prayer which follow, and the. act of 
Benediction being the only portions of liturgical ob- 
ligation. It is permitted to give the Benediction with 
the veiled ciborium.
