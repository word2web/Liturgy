ORDINATION OF READERS 311 


The ordinands kneel before the Bishop in succession. 
He places his right hand on the head of each as he says: 


In the Name of Christ our Lord, I admit thee to 
the Order of Doorkeeper. 


The Bishop hands a key and a bell to each ordinand in 
turn, saying: 


Like as he who bears the key throws open the 
church for the use of all mankind, so shalt thou throw 
open the doors of thy heart for the service of thy _ 
brethren. And as he who rings the bell summons 
men to divine worship, so by the force of good example 
shalt thou also summon men to the service of God. 

Each ordinand locks and unlocks the door of the 
church and rings the bell thrice. 


Having ordained the several candidates, he blesses the 
new Doorkeepers in the following words, unless they are 
immediately to receive another Order: 


The blessing of God Almighty, the + Father, the 
+ Son, and the Holy + Ghost come down upon you, 
that you may rightly fulfil that which to-day you 
have undertaken. KR. Amen. 


THE ORDINATION OF READERS 


At the appointed time those about to be made Readers 
are summoned by a Priest, as follows: 


Let those who are to be ordained to the Office of 
Reader come forward. 


The ordinands rise from’ their ‘seats and advance a 
few paces towards the Bishop, bearing lighted candles 
in their hands. They bow to him, the candles are then 
taken from them, and they are seated while the Bishop 
charges them, as follows: 


We learn from ancient tradition that it belonged 
to the Reader in olden times to read for him who 
was about to preach, to intone the lessons, to bless 
bread and all first-fruits. The passage of time has 
stripped the office of Reader of these duties and its

functions, but it is still of the essence of his office 
that he dedicate the gifts of his mind to the glory of 
God. You have learned in the preceding Orders 
that you should control the physical body and train 
the emotions for service; and you will have seen 
from experience that in so far as your affection has . 
been bestowed upon others you have greatly helped 
to develop affection in them. It is now your duty 
at once to train your own mind and to infiuence for 
good the minds of others. As you have had to con- 
quer and control wrong tendencies of emotion, so now 
is it also necessary to discipline your thought; for 
just as you know that the physical body is not your- 
self, nor your emotions, however glorious and beauti- 
ful they may be, so also the mind is not you. Your 
thought is a power, splendid and great, given to you 
for the service of God: it also has to be your ser- 
vant and not your master. It needs careful train- 
ing, and that training is the especial purpose of this 
step which you are about to take. You will find 
yourselves prone to wandering thought; this you must 
conquer. You must develop within yourselves the 
power of concentration, that you may study effec- 
tively and communicate the results of that study to 
others, 


As you had to learn to purify emotion, so also must 
your mind be pure. As you learned to perceive the 
necessity for physical cleanliness, or to throw off 
with repugnance the lower emotion, so also must you 
thrust away unworthy thought, remembering that all 
thought is unworthy that is impure, selfish, mean or 
base; such, for example, as would seek for flaws in- 
stead of gems in thinking of the character or work 
of another. All such thought is impure beside the 
white light of the thought of the Christ, Who is 
our pattern and perfect ensample. Wherefore as 
Readers it is your duty to train and develop the 
powers of your mind, to study and fit yourselves that 
you may help to train and develop the minds of 
others.
