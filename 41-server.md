THE ADMISSION OF A SERVER 


The Priest stands at the foot of the Altar steps, the 
candidate standing before him. 


Priest. In the Name of the Father, a and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 


P. You should understand that in being admitted as 
a Server in the Church a great privilege is being 
given to you. The Altar of a Church is the throne 
of God, and a centre of most powerful spiritual in- 
fluence. You are admitted to the sanctuary, or 
specially sacred part of the Church, immediately 
around the Altar, and it is part of your duty and 
privilege to be a channel of this spiritual influence, 
and to help to pour it out upon the people. 


Therefore you take upon yourself certain respon- 
sibilities, of which you should ever try to be mind- © 
ful. You must be scrupulously clean in your per- 
son. You must follow attentively the services, that 
your thoughts may be fixed upon high and holy things, 
and that you may be in readiness to carry out punc- 
tually and accurately whatever work is entrusted to 
you. Remember that your best, and only your best, 
must be offered to God. Therefore be punctual and 
regular in your attendance at Church, and never al- 
low yourself to perform any action carelessly and 
negligently, without proper thought. Your actions 
should be the outcome of thoughts of devotion and 
reverence, so that whatever you do shall be done 
beautifully, and as perfectly as may be. Try to 
enter into the spirit of service, remembering that 
“‘even the Son of Man came not to be ministered 
unto, but to minister.’’ So shall you find joy and 
peace in the service of God’s holy Church, and the 
hand of Christ be laid upon you in tender love and 
blessing.

— 


The candidate kneels before the Priest. 


_ P. Wilt thou strive earnestly to practise these 
duties ? 


Candidate. I will. 


P. The Lord keep thee in all these things, well- 
beloved son, and strengthen thee in all goodness. R. 
Amen. 


The Priest says the following prayer with hands ea- 
tended towards. the candidate. 


O Lord Christ, Who art ever ready to receive and 
to strengthen the earnest aspirations of Thy children, 
look down in Thy love upon this Thy servant who 
desires to minister as a Server in Thy holy Church. 
Sanctify + him, O Lord, with Thy heavenly grace, 
that growing continually in virtue he may rightly 
practise the duties of his office, and so be found ac- 
ceptable in Thy sight, O Thou great King of Love 
and Wisdom, to Whom be glory for ever and ever. 
R. Amen. 


The Priest lays his hand upon the candidate’s 
head, raising it only to make the sign of the cross, and 
says: 

The blessing of God Almighty, the Father, + the 
Son, and the Holy Ghost, come down upon thee, that 
thou mayest rightly fulfil that which to-day thou 
hast undertaken. R. Amen. 





If it be thought well to admit in solemn manner per- 
sons appointed to other duties in the Church, or to bless 
any who engage in good works, the Priest should use 
the above form with necessary modifications, omitting 
the charge and promise or substituting another.
