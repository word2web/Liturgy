# Confirmation

Confirmation is, literally, the making of the person firm or strong in the life in Christ begun at Baptism. It has the two-fold effect of strengthening the soul, and giving it greater power to express itself through the body.

The candidate pledges himself to endeavour to set aside the smaller life of personal interests and to work in the common interest. Having offered himself thereunto as a knight in Christ's service, the sacramental act of Confirmation follows, and he is sealed once again with the sign of the holy cross, the emblem of the life of sacrifice and service.

*The candidates for Confirmation are seated in due order before the Bishop outside the chancel—their sponsors also, if still alive and able to attend, being near at hand to present them at the proper time.*

## The Invocation

**Bishop.** In the Name of the Father, † and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  
**R.** Amen.

*The Bishop is seated before the Altar. If desired, an address may here be delivered to the candidates, explaining to them the nature of the Sacrament of Confirmation, and of the responsibilities they take upon themselves. The Bishop delivers the following charge:*

---

## The Charge

My beloved children: on your entry into this mortal life you were brought into the house of God, and our holy Mother the Church met you with such help as then you could receive. Now that you can think and speak for yourselves, she offers you a further boon—the gift of God's most Holy Spirit. This world in which we live is God's world, and it is growing better and better day by day and year by year; but it is still far from perfect. There is still much of sin and selfishness; there are still many who know not God, neither understand His laws. So there is a constant struggle between good and evil, and, since you are members of Christ's Church, you will be eager to take your stand upon God's side and fight under the banner of our Lord.

> *In the case of adults the foregoing is omitted and the following used instead:*

> Since you are members of Christ's Church, you will be eager to take your stand upon God's side and fight under the banner of our Lord in the constant struggle between good and evil.

*In the case of both adults and children the charge continues as follows:*

In this Sacrament of Confirmation the Church gives you both the opportunity to enrol yourselves in Christ's army and the strength to quit yourselves like men.

But if you enter His most holy service take heed that you are such soldiers as He would have you be. Strong must you be (as the lion),* yet gentle (as the lamb), ready ever to protect the weak, watchful ever to help where help is needed, to give reverence to those to whom it is due, and to show knightly courtesy to all. Never forgetting that God is Love, make it your constant care to shed love around you wherever you may go; so will you fan into living flame the smouldering fires of love in the hearts of those in whom as yet the spark burns low. Remember that the Soldier of the Cross must utterly uproot from his heart the giant weed of Selfishness, and must live not for himself but for the service of the world; for this commandment have we from Him, that he who loveth God love his brother also. Remember that the power of God, which you are now about to receive from my hand, will ever work within you for righteousness, inclining you unto a noble and upright life. Strive therefore earnestly that your thoughts, your words, and your works shall be such as befit a child of Christ and a knight dedicated to His service. All this shall you zealously try to do for Christ's sweet sake and in His most holy Name.

> *The words in parentheses are omitted in the case of adults.*

## The Interrogations

*All rise, and the Bishop addresses the candidates as follows:*

**Bishop.** Will you then strive to live in the spirit of love with all mankind, and manfully to fight against sin and selfishness?  
**Candidates.** I will.

**Bishop.** Will you strive to show forth in your thoughts, your words and your works, the power of God which shall be given to you?  
**Candidates.** I will.

*The candidates kneel; and the Bishop blesses them as follows:*

**Bishop.** May the † blessing of the Holy Ghost come down upon you, and may the power of the Most High preserve you in all your ways.  
**R.** Amen.

*The following hymn is sung, all kneeling:*

### *Veni Creator*

> Come, Thou Creator Spirit blest,  
> And in our souls take up Thy rest;  
> Come with Thy grace and heavenly aid,  
> To fill the hearts which Thou hast made.  
>  
> Great Paraclete, to Thee we cry,  
> O highest gift of God most high;  
> O living Fount, O Fire, O Love,  
> And sweet anointing from above!  
>  
> Thou in Thy sevenfold gifts art known;  
> Thee, Finger of God's Hand, we own,  
> The promise of the Father, Thou  
> Who dost the tongue with power endow.  
>  
> Kindle our senses from above,  
> And make our hearts o'erflow with love;  
> With patience firm and virtue high  
> The weakness of our flesh supply.  
>  
> Far let us drive our tempting foe,  
> And Thine abiding peace bestow;  
> So shall we not, with Thee for guide,  
> Turn from the path of life aside.  
>  
> O may Thy grace on us bestow  
> The Father and the Son to know,  
> And Thee, through endless times confessed,  
> Of both eternal Spirit blest.  
>  
> All glory while the ages run  
> Be to the Father and the Son,  
> Who gave us life; the same to Thee,  
> O Holy Ghost, eternally. Amen.

## The Confirmation

*Each candidate is severally led up to the Bishop and instructed to kneel upon the cushion and to place his hands together, palm to palm, resting them upon the gremial which covers the Bishop's knees.*

*The candidate (prompted if necessary) says:*

Right Reverend Father, I offer myself to be a knight in Christ's service.

*The Bishop, taking the candidate's hands between his own and pressing them lightly, answers:*

In Christ's most holy Name do I accept thee.

*The Bishop takes some chrism upon his right thumb, and placing his right hand upon the head of the candidate, says:*

Receive the Holy Ghost for the sweet savour of a godly life; whereunto I do † sign thee with the Sign of the cross, and I confirm thee with the chrism of salvation. In the Name of the † Father, and of the † Son, and of the Holy † Ghost.  
**R.** Amen.

*At the words, "I do sign thee," the Bishop makes the sign of the cross with the chrism upon the forehead of the neophyte. He makes the sign of the cross three times over the head of the neophyte as he recites the Names of the Holy Trinity. After a momentary pause, the Bishop again lays his hand upon the head of the neophyte, saying:*

Therefore go thou forth, my brother, in the Name of the Lord, for in His strength thou canst do all things.

*The Bishop touches the neophyte lightly on the left cheek, saying:*

Peace be with thee.

*The neophyte rises, bows reverently to the Bishop, and is led back to his seat.*

*When all have been confirmed, the following hymn is sung:*

### Hymn

> O Master, I have promised  
> To serve Thee to the end;  
> Be Thou for ever near me,  
> My Helper and my Friend;  
> I shall not fear the battle  
> If Thou art by my side,  
> Nor wander from the pathway,  
> If Thou wilt be my Guide.  
>  
> O let me feel Thee near me;  
> The world is ever near;  
> I see the sights that dazzle,  
> The tempting sounds I hear;  
> My foes are ever near me,  
> Around me and within;  
> But in Thy holy Presence  
> I shield my soul from sin.  
>  
> O let me hear Thee speaking  
> In accents clear and still,  
> Above the storms of passion,  
> The murmurs of self-will;  
> O speak to reassure me,  
> To hasten or control;  
> O speak sweet words of counsel,  
> Thou Guardian of my soul.  
>  
> O Master, Thou hast promised  
> To all who follow Thee  
> That where Thou art in glory  
> There shall Thy servants be;  
> And, Master, I have promised  
> To serve Thee to the end;  
> May I find strength to follow,  
> My Master and my Friend.  
>  
> O let me see Thy foot-marks,  
> And in them plant mine own;  
> My hope to follow duly  
> Is in Thy strength alone.  
> O guide me, call me, draw me,  
> Uphold me to the end;  
> And then in bliss receive me,  
> My Master and my Friend. Amen.

## The Final Exhortation

*The Bishop, seating himself, addresses the newly-confirmed as follows:*

My brothers, now have you received the gift of the Holy Ghost; see ye to it that your bodies are ever pure and clean, as befits the temple of the most high God, and the channel of so great a power; and understand that as you keep that channel open by a useful life spent in the service of others, so will His life that is within you shine forth with ever greater and greater glory.

*The Bishop rises and faces towards the Altar; the newly-confirmed kneel.*

**Bishop.** Our help is in the Name of the Lord.  
**Congregation.** Who hath made heaven and earth.  

**Bishop.** Blessed are the pure in heart.  
**Congregation.** For they shall see God.  

**Bishop.** Trust ye in the Lord for ever.  
**Congregation.** For He is our Rock of Ages.  

**Bishop.** The Lord be with you.  
**Congregation.** And with thy spirit.  

**Bishop.** Let us pray.

*The Bishop extends his hands towards the newly-confirmed, and says:*

O Lord Christ, Who didst give the Holy Spirit to Thine apostles, and didst ordain that by them and their successors He should be given to the rest of the faithful, we render Thee hearty thanks for this Thine inestimable benefit now bestowed upon us.

We offer unto Thee the lives which Thou to-day hast blessed, that they, whom Thou hast thus accepted as soldiers in Thy Church militant here on earth, may so bear themselves as true and faithful knights in Thy service, that they may be found worthy hereafter to stand before Thee in the ranks of the Church triumphant, O Thou great King of Glory, to Whom be praise and adoration from men and from the Angel host.  
**R.** Amen.

## The Benediction

*The Bishop blesses the persons confirmed as follows:*

God the † Father, God the † Son, God the † Holy Ghost, bless, preserve and sanctify you; the Lord in His lovingkindness look down upon you and be gracious unto you; the Lord lift up the light of His Countenance upon you and give you His peace, now and for evermore.  
**R.** Amen.

May the Holy Ones, Whose pupils you aspire to become, show you the Light you seek, give you the strong aid of Their compassion and Their wisdom. There is a peace that passeth understanding; it abides in the hearts of those who live in the Eternal; there is a power that maketh all things new; it lives and moves in those who know the Self as One. May that peace brood over you, that power uplift you, till you stand where the One Initiator is invoked, till you see His † Star shine forth.  
**R.** Amen.

> *If the sacrament of Confirmation is administered during the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist, or in connection with any other service, the second benediction given above shall not be used. It may be used only when the Confirmation is an entirely separate service.*

## Notes on Practice

- The term *"gremial"* refers to the cloth (often silk) spread over the Bishop's knees upon which the candidate rests his hands during the rite.
- The phrase *"prevent thee"* (found in related rites) is used in its archaic liturgical sense meaning *"to go before and protect."*
- The esoteric language in the second benediction ("One Initiator," "His Star") reflects a particular strand of early 20th-century Anglo-Catholic spirituality influenced by mystical and theosophical currents; it is preserved here as part of the original liturgical text.
- The sign † (cross) is made by the Bishop at each invocation of the Holy Trinity and at key moments of blessing and signing.
