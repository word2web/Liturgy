CONFIRMATION 


Confirmation is, literally, the making of the person firm 
or strong in the life in Christ begun at baptism. It 
has the two-fold effect of strengthening the soul, and 
giving it greater power to express itself through the 
body. 


The candidate pledges himself to endeavour to set 
aside the smaller life of personal interests and to work 
in the common interest. Having offered himself 
thereunto as a knight in Christ’s service, the sacra- 
mental act of Confirmation follows, and he is sealed 
once again with the sign of the holy cross, the emblem 
of the life of sacrifice and service. 





The candidates for Confirmation are seated in due 
order before the Bishop outside the chancel—thetr spon- 
sors also, if still alive and able to attend, being near at 
hand to present them at the proper time. 


THE INVOCATION 


Bishop. In the Name of the Father, yy and of 
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. R. Amen. 


The Bishop is seated before the Altar. If desired, 
an address may here be delivered to the candidates, ea- 
plaining to them the nature of the Sacrament of Con- 
firmation, and of the responsibilities they take upon them- 
selves. The Bishop delivers the following charge: 


THE CHARGE 


My beloved children: on your entry into this mortal 
life you were brought into the house of God, and our 
holy Mother the Church met you with such help as 
then you could receive. Now that you can think 
and speak for yourselves, she offers you a further 
boon—the gift of God’s most Holy Spirit. This 
world in which we live is God’s world, and it is 
growing better and better day by day and year by 
year; but it is still far from perfect. There is still 
much of sin and selfishness; there are still many

who know not God, neither understand His laws. 
So there is a constant struggle between good and 
evil, and, since you are members of Christ’s Church, 
you will be eager to take your stand upon God’s side 
and fight under the banner of our Lord. 





In the case of adults the foregoing is omitted and the 
following used instead: 


Since you are members of Christ’s Church, you will 
be eager to take your stand upon God’s side and 
fight under the banner of our Lord in the constant 
struggle between good and evil. 





In the case of both adults and children the charge 
continues as follows: 


In this Sacrament of Confirmation the Church gives 
you both the opportunity to enrol yourselves in 
Christ’s army and the strength to quit yourselves 
like men. : 


But if you enter His most holy service take heed 
that you are such soldiers as He would have you 
be. Strong must you be (as the lion),* yet gentle 
(as the lamb), ready ever to protect the weak, watch- 
ful ever to help where help is needed, to give re- 
verence to those to whom it is due, and to. show 
knightly courtesy to all. Never forgetting that God 
is Love, make it your constant care to shed love 
around you wherever you may g0; so will you fan 
into living flame the smouldering fires of love in the 
hearts of those in whom as yet the spark burns 
low. Remember that the Soldier of the Cross: must 
utterly uproot from his heart the giant weed of 
Selfishness, and must live not for himself but for the 
service of the world; for this commandment have 
we from Him, that he who loveth God love his

brother also. Remember that the power of God, 
which you are now about to receive from my hand, 
will ever work within you for righteousness, inclin- 
ing you unto a noble and upright life. Strive there- 
fore earnestly that your thoughts, your words, and 
your works shall be such as befit a child of Christ 
and a knight dedicated to His service. All this shall 
you zealously try to do for Christ’s sweet sake and 
in His most holy Name. 


THE INTERROGATIONS 


All rise, and the Bishop addresses the candidates as 
follows: 

Will you then strive to live in the spirit of love 
with all mankind, and manfully to fight against sin 
and selfishness ? 


Candidates. I will. 


Will you strive to show forth in your thoughts, 
your words and your works, the power of God which 
shall be given to you? 


c. I will. 


The candidates kneel; and the Bishop blesses them 
as follows: 


May the >» blessing of the Holy Ghost come 
down upon you, and may the power of the Most 
High preserve you in all your ways. R. Amen. 


The following hymn is sung, all kneeling: — 
VENI CREATOR 


Come, Thou Creator Spirit blest, 

And in our souls take up Thy rest; 

Come with Thy grace and heavenly aid, 
To fill the hearts which Thou hast made. 


Great Paraclete, to Thee we cry, 

O highest gift of God most high; 
O living Fount, O Fire, O Love, 
And sweet anointing from above! 


254 CONFIRMATION 





Thou in Thy sevenfold gifts art known; 
Thee, Finger of God’s Hand, we own, 
The promise of the Father, Thou 

Who dost the tongue with power endow. 


Kindle our senses from above, 

And make our hearts o’erflow with love; 
With patience firm and virtue high 

The weakness of our flesh supply. 


Far let us drive our tempting foe, 
And Thine abiding peace bestow; 

So shall we not, with Thee for guide, 
Turn from the path of life aside. 


O may Thy grace on us bestow 

The Father and the Son to know, 

And Thee, through endless times confessed 
Of both eternal Spirit blest. 


2 


All glory while the ages run 

Be to the Father and the Son, 
Who gave us life; the same to Thee 
O Holy Ghost, eternally. Amen,

THE CONFIRMATION 


Each candidate is severally led wp to the Bishop 
and instructed to kneel upon the cushion and to place his 
hands together, palm to palm, resting them upon the 
gremial which covers the Bishop’s knees. 


The candidate (prompted if necessary) says . 


Right Reverend Father, I offer myself to be a knight 
in Christ’s service. 


The Bishop, taking the candidate’s hands between 
his own and pressing them lightly, answers: 


In Christ’s most holy Name do I accept thee. 


The Bishop takes some chrism upon his right thumb, 
and placing his right hand upon the head of the can- 
didate, says: 


CONFIRMATION 255 


Receive the Holy Ghost for the sweet savour of a 
godly life; whereunto I do + sign thee with the 
Sign of the cross, and I confirm thee with the chrism 
of salvation. In the Name of the + Father, and 
of the + Son, and of the Holy + Ghost. R. Amen. 


At the words, ‘‘I do sign thee,’’ the Bishop makes 
the sign of the cross with the chrism upon the fore- 
head of the neophyte. He makes the sign of the 
cross three times over the head of the neophyte as he 
recites the Names of the Holy Trinity. After a mo- 
mentary pause, the Bishop again lays his hand upon 
the head of the neophyte, saying: 

Therefore go thou forth, my brother, in the Name 
of the Lord, for in His strength thou canst do all 
things. 

The Bishop touches the neophyte lightly on the left 
cheek, saying: 

Peace be with thee. 


The neophyte rises, bows reverently to the Bishop, 
and is led back to his seat. 
When all have been confirmed, the following hymn is 
sung: 
HYMN 
O Master, I have promised 
To serve Thee to the end; 
Be Thou for ever near me, 
My Helper and my Friend; 
I shall not fear the battle 
If Thou art by my side, 
Nor wander from the pathway, 
If Thou wilt be my Guide. 


O let me feel Thee near me; 
The world is ever near; 

I see the sights that dazzle, 
The tempting sounds I hear; 

- My foes are ever near me, 

Around me and within; 

But in Thy holy Presence 
I shield my soul from sin. 


256 CONFIRMATION 


O let me hear Thee speaking 
In accents clear and still, 
Above the storms of passion, 
The murmurs of self-will; 
O speak to reassure me, 
To hasten or control; 
O speak sweet words of counsel, 
Thou Guardian of my soul. 


O Master, Thou hast promised 
To all who follow Thee 

That where Thou art in glory 
There shall Thy servants be; 

And, Master, I have promised 
To serve Thee to the end; 

May I find strength to follow, 
My Master and my Friend. 


O let me see Thy foot-marks, 
And in them plant mine own; 
My hope to follow duly 
Is in Thy strength alone. 
O guide me, call me, draw me, 
Uphold me to the end; 
And then in bliss receive me, 
My Master and my Friend. Amen, 


The Bishop, seating himself, addresses the newly- 
confirmed as follows: 


My brothers, now have you received the gift of 
the Holy Ghost; see ye to it that your bodies are 
ever pure and clean, as befits the temple of the most 
high God, and the channel of so great a power; and 
. understand that as you keep that channel open by a 
useful life spent in the service of others, so will His 
life that is within you shine forth with ever great-— 
er and greater glory. 


The Bishop rises and faces towards the Altar; the 
newly-confirmed kneel. 


Bishop. 44 Our help is in the Name of the Lord. 
Congregation. Who hath made heaven and earth. 


CONFIRMATION 


Sop ee ee See 
Blessed are the pure in heart. 
For they shall see God. 
Trust ye in the Lord for: ever. 
For He is our Rock of Ages. 
The Lord be with you. 
And with Thy spirit. 
Let us pray. 

The Bishop eatends his hands towards the newly- 
confirmed, and says: ; ' 

O Lord Christ, Who didst give the Holy Spirit to 
Thine apostles, and didst ordain that by them and 
their successors He should be given to the rest of the 


faithful, we render Thee hearty thanks for this 
Thine inestimable benefit now bestowed upon us. 


We offer unto Thee the lives which Thou to-day 
hast blessed, that they, whom Thou hast thus ac- 
cepted as soldiers in Thy Church militant here on 
earth, may so bear themselves as true and faithful 
knights in Thy service, that they may be found 
worthy hereafter to stand before Thee in the ranks 
of the Church triumphant, O Thou great King of 
Glory, to Whom be praise and adoration from men 
and from the Angel host. R. Amen. 


THE BENEDICTION 


The Bishop blesses the persons confirmed as fol- 
lows: : 


God the ++ Father, God the + Son, God the + Holy 
Ghost, bless, preserve and sanctify you; the Lord 
in His lovingkindness look down upon you and be 
gracious unto you; the Lord lift up the light of His 
Countenance upon you and give you His peace, now 
and for evermore. R. Amen. 

May the Holy Ones, Whose pupils you aspire to be- 
-come, show you the Light you seek, give you the 
strong aid of Their compassion and Their wisdom. 
There is a peace that passeth understanding; it abides 

I

in the hearts of those who live in the Eternal; there 
is a power that maketh all things new; it lives and 
moves in those who know the Self as One. May that 
peace brood over you, that power uplift you, till you 
stand where the One Initiator is invoked, till you 
see His > Star shine forth, R. Amen. 


If the sacrament of Confirmation is administered dur- 
ing the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist, or in con- 
nection with any other service, the second benediction 
given above shall not be used. It may be used only 
when the Confirmation is an entirely separate service.
