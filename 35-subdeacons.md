THE ORDINATION OF SUBDEACONS 





The Bishop celebrates the Holy Eucharist, using the 
following special Collect: 


THE COLLECT 


Almighty everlasting God, by Whose Spirit the 
whole body of the Church is made holy and govern- 
ed, do Thou pour forth Thy sanctifying grace into 
the hearts of these Thy servants, who are about to 
be numbered among the Subdeacons of Thy Church, 
that with pure heart and open mind they may faith- 
fully receive Thy blessing from on high. Through 
Christ our Lord. R. Amen. 


The Collect of the Day and the Collect for Peace fol- 
low here. 


The Collects being ended, the Bishop takes his seat 
upon a faldstool before the Altar. The ordinands come 
forward bearing Vighted candles. The Bishop charges 
them as follows: 


Dearly beloved sons, this Order of Subdeacon is 
a grade of probation for the Greater Orders of Dea- 
con and Priest. It gives to those who receive it 
greater strength and steadfastness of purpose, to 
the end that with singleness of heart they may dedi- 
cate their lives to Christ in His holy Church. So 
great, indeed, is the responsibility laid upon those 
who in these Greater Orders become Christ’s repre- 
sentatives, that a season of trial in this preparatory 
grade of the Subdiaconate is ofttimes appointed, 
wherein they who aspire to so sublime an estate may 
test themselves if need be, more especially if they 
be young in body or in experience of matters ecclesi- 
astical, that they enter not lightly or unadvisedly 
upon so solemn an undertaking. 


You, well-beloved sons, having already offered 
yourselves to the service of God and to help forward

ORDINATION OF SUBDEACONS 321 


His kingdom upon earth, are now moved in your 
hearts to devote yourselves still further to His ser- 
vice and to that of your brethren. On this purpose 
we invoke the Divine blessing; and, with the help 
and ready concurrence of the faithful here assembled, 
shall now proceed in the exercise of our office to bring 
you as a holy oblation into the Presence of Christ, 
not doubting that at the latter end you, having the 
witness of faithful service, will shine, pure and lus- 
trous, as jewels in the crown of our Master. 


The Bishop rises and addresses the congregation as 
follows: 


Let us then pray, dearest brethren, that Almighty 
God in His great lovingkindness and watchful care 
over His Church may bestow a plentiful grace on 
these Acolytes, now about to be raised to the Order 
of the Subdiaconate. 


LITANY. 


All kneel and sing the following Litany, during which 
the ordinands lie prostrate: 


[If it should happen that the candidates are all to 
‘eceive the Diaconate immediately after this Order, the 
Litany given in the service for the Ordination of a 
Deacon is here substituted. |

God the Co-eternal Son, 

God the Spirit, with Them One; 
Hear us, Holy Trinity. 


God eternal, mighty King, 

Unto Thee, our love we bring; 

Through the world Thy praises ring; 
We are Thine, O Trinity.

324 ORDINATION OF SUBDEACONS 
The following verse is sung by all: 


God the Father, seen of none, 
God the Co-eternal Son, 
God the Spirit, with Them One; 
We are Thine, O Trinity. 


The people are seated. 


The Bishop and ordinands are again seated, and the 
Bishop charges them in this wise: 


Dearly beloved sons, who are about to be admitted 
to the office of Subdeacon, you should know what 
manner of ministry was in former times committed 
unto your Order. It appertained to the Subdeacon 
to provide water for the service of the Altar, to min- 
ister to the Deacon, to wash the Altar cloths and 
‘corporals, to present to the Deacon the chalice and 
paten to be used at the Sacrifice, to guard the church 
doors or the gates of the sanctuary, and in later 
times to read the Epistles before the people. En- 
deavour, then, by fulfilling readily with neatness and 
diligence such of these visible ministries as are still 
part of your office, to show true reverence for the 
invisible things they may be said to typify. For 
the Altar of holy Church is the throne of Christ 
Himself, and it is indeed fitting that they who min- 
ister before it should walk circumspectly, and rea- 
lize that upon them is laid the high honour of its 
guardianship. Do you therefore take heed that you 
be watchful sentinels of the heavenly warfare, so 
that growing ever in virtue you may shine, lustrous 
and chaste, in the company of the saints. Strive 
earnestly to pattern yourselves after the ensample 
of our divine Master, that you may meetly minister 
at the divine Sacrifice, as well in the invisible sanc- 
tuary of your hearts as in the visible sanctuary of 
holy Church. 


From ancient times, also, it has been required of 
those who enter this Order that they strive to acquire 
certain virtues of character, such as are typified by 


ORDINATION OF SUBDEACONS 325 


the vestments delivered unto them. By the amice, 
control of speech; by the maniple, the love of service 
or diligence in all good works; by the tunicle, the 
spirit of joy and gladness, or freedom from care and 
depression, that is to say, confidence in the Good 
Law, which may be interpreted as a recognition of 
the Plan revealed by Almighty God for the perfect- 
ing of His creation. 


The ordinands rise. 


B. Will you then strive, as far as in you lies, to 
order your lives in accordance with these precepts ? 


Ordinands. I will. 


B. The Lord keep you in all these things, well- 
beloved sons, and strengthen you in all goodness. R. 
Amen. 


The Bishop rises, and with hands extended towards 
the ordinands, who kneel before him, says the follow- 
ing prayer: 

O Lord Christ, the Fountain of all goodness, Who - 
bestowest upon all who serve Thee in Thy holy Church 
the gifts pertaining to their several offices, gracious- 
ly regard these Thy servants whom we now present 
for the Order of the Subdiaconate, and so + open 
their hearts and minds to Thy heavenly grace that they 
may be steadfast in Thy holy service. Increase in 
them, O Lord, the sevenfold gift of the Spirit, that, 
growing in the knowledge of things eternal, they 
may offer their lives as a holy and continual sacri- 
fice unto Thee, O Thou great King of Love, to Whom 
be praise and adoration from men and from the Angel 
host. R. Amen. 


The ordinands kneel before the Bishop in succession. 
He places his right hand on the head of each, and SAYS: 


In the Name of our Lord Christ, I admit thee to 
the Order of Subdeacon. 


The Bishop is seated, He hands an empty chalice 


326 ORDINATION OF SUBDEACONS 


and paten to each ordinand, who touches it with the 
right hand, while the Bishop says: 


Take heed to that the ministry whereof is com- 
mitted to thee; I admonish thee so to demean thy- 
self in thy ministry as to be commendable in the 
sight of God. 


The Bishop touches the amice which is upon the neck 
of each ordinand, saying: 

Take the amice, by which restraint of the tongue 
is signified. In the Name of the + Father, and 
of the + Son, and of the Holy + Ghost. R. Amen. 


The Bishop places the maniple on the left arm of each, 
saying : 

Take the maniple, by which is meant the fruit of 
good works. In the Name of the + Father, and 
of the + Son, and of the Holy + Ghost. R. Amen. 


The Bishop vests one after another in the tunicle, 
' saying: 


May the Lord clothe thee with the garment of glad- 
ness and the vesture of joy. In the Name of the 
+ Father, and of the + Son, and of the Holy + 
Ghost. R. Amen. 


The Bishop hands to each the Book of Epistles, say- 
ing as he touches it with the right hand: 


Take the Book of Hpistles, and receive authority 
to read them in God’s holy Church, both for the 
living and the dead. In the Name of the + Father, 
and of the + Son, and of the Holy + Ghost. BR. 
Amen. 


He rises, and blesses them in this wise: 


The blessing of God Almighty, the + Father, the 
+ Son, and the Holy + Ghost come down upon you 
that with steadfastness and zeal you may persevere 
in that which to-day you have undertaken. R, Amen 





ORDINATION OF SUBDEACONS 327 


One of the newly ordained Subdeacons, vested in tun- 
icle, reads the Epistle of the Day. 


The Holy Eucharist is then continued to its close. 


IN THE PRAYER OF CONSECRATION 


In the Prayer of Consecration the following clause is 
inserted after the words: ‘‘for all our Bishops, clergy 
and faithful’’: 

Especially for these whom in Christ’s holy Name 
we have admitted to the Order of the Subdiaconate.
